Color correction, as the first step, is to adjust the color and luminance of source images so that the differences between adjacent images can be minimized. Color blending is used after the color correction to further smooth the color transition between adjacent images. With the first image being selected as a basis image, the proposed approach can start the color matching and stitching process once the second image is captured. The proposed approach is simple and is very suitable for panoramic imaging on mobile devices. Experimental results demonstrate that the color transitions between neighboring images are smooth without visible seams and the color tone of the final image is kept as close as the basis image.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2345773","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6872562","Color blending;color correction;mobile panorama;photometric consistency","Image color analysis;Imaging;Image sequences;Mobile handsets;Mobile communication;Signal processing algorithms;Smoothing methods","","17","","14","IEEE","6 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nevertheless, it is inconvenient to set the detection thresholds by using these integral expressions. Here, we propose two computationally efficient schemes to calculate the thresholds of the AMF and ACE. In the first method, approximate expressions, in forms of elementary functions, for the PFAs of the AMF and ACE are derived. The thresholds of the AMF and ACE can be numerically computed by using these elementary expressions instead of the integrals, for reducing computational complexity. In the second approach, further approximations are employed to lead to highly simple expressions for the thresholds of the AMF and ACE, which enable us to directly compute the thresholds for a given PFA. Compared to the first one, the second scheme is more computationally efficient, but at the cost of a slight loss in accuracy. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the two proposed schemes.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2345757","Air Force Research Laboratory(grant numbers:FA8650-08-D-1303); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6875898","Adaptive coherence estimator;adaptive detection;adaptive matched filter;generalized likelihood ratio test;Laplace approximation;Rao test","Approximation methods;Accuracy;Noise;Covariance matrices;Training data;Detectors;Coherence","","13","","17","IEEE","11 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The angles between subspaces and the generalized Kullback-Leibler divergence are used in characterizing the alignment and separation. Minimizing the divergence leads to maximal subspace separation and best alignment, thus allowing improved performance.

One of the biggest problems remaining in using adaptive filters for feedback cancellation is the biased estimation of the filter's coefficients. In order to remove the undesired correlation between the loudspeaker and incoming signal, a recent alternative scheme proposed to employ an additional microphone. This microphone can provide added information to obtain an incoming signal estimate. This estimate is removed from the primary microphone signal to create the error signal which adapts the canceler's coefficients. This letter provides the theoretical analysis for the two microphone method. It presents analytic expressions showing that the optimal solution is no longer dependent on the signal correlation aforementioned but is now mainly determined by the additional feedback path. Finally, it demonstrates simulation results with the prediction error method in terms of misalignment and maximum gain for a proposed microphone placement. The results show that a more stable solution is obtained with the proposed two microphone approach.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2345571","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6873235","Acoustic feedback cancellation;bias problem;dual microphone;two microphone","Microphones;Acoustics;Speech;Loudspeakers;Ear;Correlation;Delays","","56","","19","IEEE","7 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A boundary usually refers to the border between two regions with different semantic meanings. Therefore, a measurement of dissimilarity between image regions plays a pivotal role in boundary detection of natural images. To improve the performance of boundary detection, a Learning-based Boundary Metric (LBM) is proposed to replace χ2 difference adopted by the classical algorithm mPb. Compared with χ2 difference, LBM is composed of a single layer neural network and an RBF kernel, and is fine-tuned by supervised learning rather than human-crafted. It is more effective in describing the dissimilarity between natural image regions while tolerating large variance of image data. After substituting χ2 difference with LBM, the F-measure metric of mPb on the BSDS500 benchmark is increased from 0.69 to 0.71. Moreover, when image features are computed on a single scale, the proposed LBM algorithm still achieves competitive results compared with mPb, which makes use of multi-scale image features.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2346232","National High Technology Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2012AA011004); National High Technology Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2013BAK02B04); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6873299","Boundary detection;logistic function;neural network;RBF kernel;stochastic gradient descent","Measurement;Feature extraction;Kernel;Vectors;Neural networks;Signal processing algorithms;Supervised learning","","3","","16","IEEE","7 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this context, the automated learning of a suitable basis or overcomplete dictionary from training data sets of certain signal classes for use in sparse representations has turned out to be of particular importance regarding practical signal processing applications. Most popular dictionary learning algorithms involve NP-hard sparse recovery problems in each iteration, which may give some indication about the complexity of dictionary learning but does not constitute an actual proof of computational intractability. In this technical note, we show that learning a dictionary with which a given set of training signals can be represented as sparsely as possible is indeed \ssb NP-hard. Moreover, we also establish hardness of approximating the solution to within large factors of the optimal sparsity level. Furthermore, we give \ssb NP-hardness and non-approximability results for a recent dictionary learning variation called the sensor permutation problem. Along the way, we also obtain a new non-approximability result for the classical sparse recovery problem from compressed sensing.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2345761","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6873279","Compressed sensing;computational complexity;(SAS-MALN, MLSAS-SPARSE) machine learning","Dictionaries;Approximation methods;Signal processing algorithms;Approximation algorithms;Complexity theory;Sparse matrices;Optimization","","63","","46","IEEE","7 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The ESPAR antenna uses a single radio-frequency (RF) front end, and its beamforming is achieved by adjusting reactance loads of parasitic elements coupled to the central active element. In the proposed beamforming method, the MVDR beamformer optimizes weights applied to outputs of beams. The optimization problem is formulated as a second-order-cone programming (SOCP) problem including a Euclidean distance metric to approximate the optimal equivalent weight vector to a feasible solution. Then the ESPAR beampattern design strategy iterates between the SOCP problem and a simple projection of reactance loads. The simulations show that the proposed MVDR beamforming method based on an ESPAR antenna gives a beam steering at the desired direction and placing nulls at the interfering directions, and it converges fast. However, when the desired source is close to the interferer, the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) degrades and where we use the interference-plus-noise sample covariance matrix to improve the beamforming performance.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2349574","China Scholarship Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6880345","Adaptive beamforming;ESPAR;MVDR;SOCP","Array signal processing;Vectors;Arrays;Signal processing algorithms;Radio frequency;Adaptive arrays","","30","","12","IEEE","19 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this case, most high resolution techniques fail to estimate the two DoAs if the waveforms are highly correlated. Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLE) are known to be more robust, but their excessive computational load limits their use in practice. In this paper, we propose an asymptotic approximation of the Unconditional Maximum Likelihood (UML) procedure in the case of a Uniform Linear Array (ULA) and two closely spaced targets. This approximation is based on an asymptotically (in the number of observations) equivalent formulation of the UML criterion, and on its Taylor series approximation for small DoA separation. This simplified procedure, which requires solving a 1D-optimization problem only, is shown to be accurate for source separation lower than half the mainlobe. Furthermore, it outperforms conventional high resolution algorithms in the case of two correlated sources.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2348011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6878452","Maximum likelihood;direction of arrival (DoA);uniformly linear array","Unified modeling language;Approximation methods;Maximum likelihood estimation;Direction-of-arrival estimation;Taylor series;Frequency estimation;Noise","","28","","22","IEEE","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In distributed compressive sensing (DCS), in addition to intra-signal correlation, inter-signal correlation is also exploited in the joint signal reconstruction, which goes beyond the aim of the conventional dictionary learning framework. In this letter, we propose a new dictionary learning framework in order to improve signal reconstruction performance in DCS applications. By capitalizing on the sparse common component and innovations (SCCI) model  , which captures both intra- and inter-signal correlation, the proposed method iteratively finds a dictionary design that promotes various goals: i) signal representation; ii) intra-signal correlation; and iii) inter-signal correlation. Simulation results showthat our dictionary design leads to an improved DCS reconstruction performance in comparison to other designs.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2350024","State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety(grant numbers:RCS2012ZT014); Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61401018,U1334202); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6880772","Compressive sensing;dictionary learning;distributed compressive sensing","Dictionaries;Correlation;Joints;Technological innovation;Electrocardiography;Educational institutions;Silicon","","22","","15","IEEE","20 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The technique gives perfect localization for infinite linear chirp-signals, impulses and constant frequency signals but not for short non-stationary signals. In this paper, a scaled reassignment is proposed, based on the spectrogram using a Gaussian window. The resulting reassignment gives perfect localization for a Gaussian function when the window length matches the function length. Based on the scaled reassignment, an algorithm that estimates the Gaussian function length is also proposed.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2350030","Vetenskapsrådet; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6880773","Gaussian;logon;reassignment;spectrogram;time-frequency","Spectrogram;Time-frequency analysis;Entropy;Chirp;Fourier transforms;Signal to noise ratio;Mathematical model","","29","","15","IEEE","20 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike conventional arts in compressed sensing, the frequencies follow an off-the-grid formulation and are continuously valued in [0, 1]. As an extension of atomic norm, the concatenated atomic norm minimization approach is proposed to handle the exact recovery of signals, which is reformulated as a computationally tractable semidefinite program. The optimality of the proposed approach is characterized using a dual certificate.

Such combined representation of cascaded systems has a potential of simplifying the simulations of the cascaded processes and easing the complexity of estimating the model parameters. When deriving the combined model, we use the fact that the marginal probability density functions (pdfs) of the real and imaginary parts of the combined process are Laplace pdfs. This fact enables us to represent the combined process with a complex Laplace AR process whose parameters are selected to capture the statistical characteristics of the combined processes. Specifically, we design the Laplace AR process to attain identical statistical temporal variation to that of the combined process using autocorrelation matching. Our derivations provide details on how to compute the parameters of the complex Laplace AR process to meet the statistical characteristics of the combined processes.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2349529","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6880378","Autoregressive;Laplace;modeling;Yule-Walker","Mathematical model;Correlation;Computational modeling;Noise;Educational institutions;Equations;Parameter estimation","","8","","14","IEEE","19 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Current weighting approaches always assume the restored estimates as independent random variables, which is inconsistent with the reality. In this letter, we analyze the correlation among the estimates and propose a bias-variance model to estimate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) under various weights. The new model exploits the overlapping information of the patches; it then utilizes the optimization to try to minimize the estimated MSE. Under this model, we propose a new weighting approach based on Quadratic Programming (QP), which can be embedded into various denoising algorithms. Experimental results show that the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) of algorithms like K-SVD and EPLL can be improved by around 0.1 dB under a range of noise levels. This improvement is promising, since it is gained independent to which image model is used, especially when the gain from designing new image models becomes less and less.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2350032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6880752","EPLL;image denoising;K-SVD","Signal processing algorithms;Noise reduction;Image denoising;Image restoration;Analytical models;Random variables","","11","","10","IEEE","20 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Numerical simulations on synthetic data are presented in order to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm to those yielded by previously reported methods. Furthermore, an example of audio denoising using the short time Fourier transform of a digital audio record, in the presence of impulsive noise, is also shown.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2349351","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6880779","Audio denoising;${\ell _1}$ -LAD;robust transforms;unitary transforms;weighted median","Transforms;Robustness;Signal processing algorithms;Estimation;Noise;Laplace equations;Dispersion","","5","","24","IEEE","20 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
