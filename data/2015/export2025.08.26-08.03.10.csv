Unfortunately, such an assumption may not be true due to radiometric variations in different views, leading to severely degraded matching results. In this letter, we propose a radiometrically invariant stereo matching algorithm called Optimal Local Adaptive Radiometric Compensation (LARAC). In LARAC, we approximate the spatially varying Pixel Value Correspondence Function (PVCF) between a corresponding pixel pair as a locally consistent polynomial within an optimal local adaptive window. The optimal polynomial coefficients are obtained for each candidate disparity value and are used to compute the matching cost. Meanwhile, a self-correction property is achieved by the proposed LARAC, leading to reduced matching errors for the outlier pixels. Experimental results suggest that the proposed LARAC outperforms other state-of-the-art stereo matching algorithms.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2350028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6880804","Radiometric variation;stereo matching","Radiometry;Lighting;Stereo vision;Signal processing algorithms;Cameras;Polynomials;Educational institutions","","8","","26","IEEE","20 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most of existing methods emphasize detecting the common salient objects in a small group of images and the objects of interest in those images have clear borders with respect to the backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel co-saliency detection method, which aims at discovering the common objects in a large and diverse image set composed of hundreds of images. First, we search a group of similar images for each image in the set. Our method is based on the overlapped groups. We handle each group with an unsupervised random forest to extract the rough contours of the common objects. Then a contrast-based measure is utilized to produce the saliency map for an individual image. For each image in the set, we collect all the maps from the groups that contain the image and fuse them together as the inter-saliency map for the image. The final co-saliency map is computed by combining the inter-saliency map with the single saliency map of this image. Experimental evaluation on an established large dataset demonstrates that our approach attains superior results and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2347333","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6880789","Co-salient object;random forest","Vegetation;Image color analysis;Object detection;Fuses;Materials;Abstracts;Indexes","","11","","22","IEEE","20 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many of these algorithms are based on the assumption that the multiple waveforms used for target scanning are orthogonal to each other in fast time. It has been shown that this assumption can limit the practical detector performance due to the reduction of the area that is clear of sidelobes in the MIMO radar ambiguity function. In this work it is shown that using the same waveform with a different carrier frequency and/or delay across different transmitters ensures relative waveform orthogonality while alleviating the negative effects on the ambiguity function. This is demonstrated in a practical scenario where the probing waveforms consist of Gaussian pulse trains (GPTs) separated in frequency. An approximate theoretical model of the ambiguity is proposed and it is shown that the effects of cross-ambiguity in the MIMO system are negligible compared to the waveform autoambiguities.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2351256","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/J015180/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6882135","Ambiguity function;Gaussian approximation;Gaussian pulse waveforms;MIMO radar","Time-frequency analysis;MIMO;MIMO radar;Approximation methods;Kernel;Frequency division multiaccess","","6","","13","IEEE","22 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The threshold of such a test is set from a desired probability of false alarm Pfa and hence this threshold depends on the statistical assumptions made about noise. In practice however, the noise statistics are seldom known and it becomes crucial to characterize Pfa under a mismatched distribution. In this letter, we address this problem in the case of a simple binary composite hypothesis testing problem (matched filter) when the threshold is designed under a Gaussian assumption while the noise actually follows an elliptically contoured distribution. We also consider the inverse situation. Generic expressions for the assumed and actual Pfa are derived and illustrated on the particular case of Student distributions for which simple, closed-form expressions are obtained. The latter show that the GLRT based on Gaussian assumption is not robust while that based on Student assumption is.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2352362","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6892991","Distribution mismatch;elliptically contoured distributions;generalized likelihood ratio test;probability of false alarm","Robustness;Noise;Distributed databases;Probability density function;Probability;Testing;Closed-form solutions","","3","","10","IEEE","5 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, we formulate these two tasks together as a bi-task labeling problem, defined in a Markov random field. An alternating direction method (ADM) is adopted for the joint inference, solving each sub-problem alternatively. More specifically, the sub-problem of image segmentation is solved by Graph Cuts, which attains discrete object labels efficiently. Depth upsampling is addressed via solving a linear system that recovers continuous depth values. By this joint scheme, robust object segmentation results and high-quality dense depth maps are achieved.

There is a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in selecting the number of PBFICs: the more PBFICs are used, the higher the accuracy, and the higher the computational cost. A question arises: how many PBFICs are required to achieve a certain level of accuracy? In this letter, we address this question by investigating the properties of bilateral filtering and deriving the linear interpolation error bounds when only a subset of PBFICs is used. The provided theoretical analysis indicates that the necessary number of PBFICs for user-provided precision depends on the range kernel and, for typical Gaussian range kernels, a small percentage (typically less than 4%) of the PBFICs are enough for good approximations.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2353694","Western Australia Office of Science Applied Research Program ARP Shark Hazard Mitigation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6892949","Bilateral filtering;linear interpolation;quantitative error analysis","Kernel;Interpolation;Accuracy;Error analysis;Real-time systems;Image processing","","3","","15","IEEE","5 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The transmitter sends its symbols with the help of L relays. As the destination has limited hardware, only U out of L signals are processed and the energy of the remaining relays is lost. To solve this problem, a joint preprocessing based detector is proposed. This joint preprocessor based detector operate on the principles of minimizing the symbol error rate (SER). For a realistic assessment, pilot symbol aided channel estimation is incorporated for this proposed detector. From our simulations, it can be observed that our proposed detector achieves the same SER performance as that of the maximum likelihood (ML) detector with all participating relays. Additionally, our detector outperforms selection combining (SC), channel shortening (CS) scheme and reduced-rank techniques when using the same U. Our proposed scheme has low computational complexity.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2349273","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6879437","Cooperative communications;MSER criteria;preprocessing matrix","Detectors;Relays;Complexity theory;Channel estimation;Joints;Hardware;Bit error rate","","2","","11","IEEE","18 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The spatial frequencies of the corresponding blocks from source images are calculated as the contrast criteria, and the blocks with the larger spatial frequencies compose the DCT presentation of the output image. Experiments on plenty of pairs of multi-focus images coded in Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) standard are conducted to evaluate the fusion performance. The results show that our fusion method improves the quality of the output image visually and outperforms the previous DCT based techniques and the state-of-art methods in terms of the objective evaluation.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2354534","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6891156","Discrete cosine transform;image fusion;multi-focus;spatial frequency","Discrete cosine transforms;Image fusion;Discrete wavelet transforms;Standards;Transform coding;Frequency-domain analysis;Visualization","","131","","20","OAPA","4 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the NMF framework, a collection of data is factorized into a basis matrix and an encoding matrix. The basis matrix for mixture data is usually constructed by augmenting the basis matrices for independent sources. However, target source separation with the concatenated basis matrix turns out to be problematic if there exists some overlap between the subspaces that the bases for the individual sources span. In this letter, we propose a novel approach to improve encoding vector estimation for target signal extraction. Estimating encoding vectors from the mixture data is viewed as a regression problem and a deep neural network (DNN) is used to learn the mapping between the mixture data and the corresponding encoding vectors. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, experiments were conducted in the speech enhancement task. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional encoding vector estimation scheme.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2354456","Ministry of Science ICT and Future Planning(grant numbers:NIPA-2013-H0301-13-4005); National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:2012R1A2A2A01045874); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6892992","Deep neural network;dictionary learning;non-negative matrix factorization;speech enhancement;target source separation","Vectors;Speech;Encoding;Noise;Speech enhancement;Source separation;Signal processing algorithms","","64","","26","IEEE","5 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We apply the quantizer to channel state information quantization for limited feedback based multi-user MIMO, employing regularized block-diagonalization precoding.

However, it is not trivial to generate subcategories of high quality, due to the difficulty in measuring the similarity between positive instances. In this letter we propose a new weakly supervised clustering method to achieve better sub-categorization. Our method provides a more precise measurement of the similarity by aligning the positive instances through latent variables and filtering the aligned features. As a better alternative to the initialization step of the latent-SVM algorithm for the learning of the multi-component models, our method can lead to a superior performance gain for object detection.
