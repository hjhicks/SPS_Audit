A block sparsity constraint is used to regularize the NMF solutions so that only one or a small number of blocks are active at a given time. Moreover, a concentrationz prior further regularizes each block of bases to be close to each other for better locality preservation.

Given training images with only image level annotations (i.e., tags) where the precise locations of tags are unknown, we simultaneously segment the images and assign tags to image regions. In contrast to previous work which segmented images at a specified scale, in this letter we propose a multiscale model for semantically segmenting images in different granularities and exploiting the long-range contextual information between adjacent scales. Then, to capture the geometric context of semantic labels, we augment the multiscale model by (i) the object spatial prior, e.g., “sky” has high probability on the top of an image, and (ii) the object spatial correlations, e.g., “car” always appears above “road”. Finally, we present an iterative top-down bottom-up method to learn the multiscale model by recovering the pixel labels of training images.

However, it is very time consuming. This letter aims at speeding up GSC. The alternating optimization framework for GSC involves repeatedly solving a variant of ${\ell _1}$ minimization referred to as GSRsub in this letter. Traditional ways to deal with GSRsub are to generalize optimization strategies for  ${\ell _1}$ minimization to solve its primal problem that is strongly convex but non-differentiable, thus converging slowly. We propose that GSC can be accelerated by solving a new dual problem of GSRsub called D-GSRsub. Compared with the primal form and the existing dual form of GSRsub, D-GSRsub has a strongly convex and smooth objective function with less variables. Based on these properties, four dual gradient ascent strategies with lower computational complexities are developed. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that these strategies can dramatically and stably speed up GSC without affecting its performance in the corresponding image analysis tasks.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2358853","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11131006,61033011,61210009,61379093); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6901263","Graph regularized sparse coding;image classification;image clustering","Linear programming;Image analysis;Optimization;Minimization;Convergence;Image classification","","4","","18","IEEE","17 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method operates over the total frequency bands simultaneously rather than a single band each time. It first estimates the number of occupied subbands, and then determines the accurate locations of occupied subbands as well as the vacant ones. Applying the ideas of multi stage Wiener filter to Gerschgorin disk estimator, this approach jointly makes the decision. In this way, the detection performance is enhanced because of capturing the signal information and suppressing the additive noise. Meanwhile, this approach avoids estimating the covariance matrix as well as the eigenvalue decomposition, and thus achieves a low computational complexity. Distinct from the conventional algorithms, neither noise power estimation nor prior knowledge of primary user signal is required, making the proposed algorithm robust to noise uncertainty and suitable for blind detection.

The proposed VAF algorithm can be divided into two phases: offline and online. In the offline phase, VAF constructs a vector space to incorporate the prior knowledge of adaptive filter coefficients from a wide range of different channel characteristics. Then, in the online phase, a mapping function is derived to estimate the adaptive filter for the testing condition using the constructed vector space. By using the vector space, VAF can effectively and efficiently estimate the parameters of the adaptive filter for the unknown testing condition. The experimental results for three designed AEC tasks demonstrate that VAF provides notably faster convergence rates compared to conventional adaptive filtering methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2360099","Industrial Technology Research Institute of Taiwan R.O.C(grant numbers:D301AR2X10¿); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6909020","Acoustic echo cancellation;prior knowledge;VAF;vector-space-based adaptive filtering algorithm","Adaptive filters;Vectors;Signal processing algorithms;Filtering algorithms;Acoustics;Convergence;Least squares approximations","","12","1","41","IEEE","24 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A Poisson point process has been shown to yield tractable and accurate results for the modeling of the interference in cognitive radio networks. We adopt this homogeneous stochastic process to develop an unified framework for deriving the energy consumption of the spectrum sensing in clustered cognitive radio networks. Furthermore, we extend the framework to multi-hop networks. The letter demonstrates that the spectrum sensing energy can be modeled as a Gamma-truncated distribution, as a function of the number of secondary users, their spatial density, and the number of hops of the cognitive radio network.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2360234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6910244","Gamma distribution;multi-hop;Poisson point process;radio spectrum;sensing energy;statistical modeling","Sensors;Energy consumption;Spread spectrum communication;Cognitive radio;Transceivers;Receivers;Interference","","17","","18","IEEE","25 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Building the fundamental of the joint design, a tight and tractable sum rate approximation is first derived by employing random matrix theory. Then the relay antenna downtilt and the number of active user pairs are jointly optimized to maximize the approximate sum rate. It is noted that the proposed scheme is independent of instantaneous channel state information. Therefore, it enjoys very low implementation complexity while improving the system performance.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2360521","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:No. 2014RC0106); National Natural Science Foundation of China NSFC(grant numbers:No. 61271188); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6911959","Antenna tilting;user scheduling;two-hop relay;large-scale antenna array;zero-forcing","Relays;Antenna arrays;Approximation methods;Vectors;Joints;Arrays","","3","","16","IEEE","26 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The resulting exact lp-NLMS algorithm manifests differences to the original one, such as an independent update for each weight, a new sparsity-promoting compensated update, and the guarantee of stable convergence for any configuration (regardless the choice of lp norm and sparsity-tradeoff constant). Simulation results show that the exact lp-NLMS is stable and it outperforms the original one, thus validating the optimality of the proposed methodology.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2360889","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6913546"," ${\ell _p}$-norm constraint;normalized least mean square (NLMS) algorithm;Newton optimization;sparsity","Signal processing algorithms;Least squares approximations;Algorithm design and analysis;Cost function;Vectors;Adaptive algorithms;Approximation algorithms","","19","","20","IEEE","30 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, a graphical model is proposed where edges are corresponding to links between local and nonlocal neighboring pixels. Local edges are weighted by a pixel dissimilarity measure, and spatial distances are incorporated into calculation of nonlocal weights. Second, user-defined values are mapped to probabilities that marked pixels have the maximum depth value, and the probabilities of unmarked pixels are obtained by NRW algorithm. Finally, the dense depth-map is recovered with the resulting probabilities. Since nonlocal principle is effective in preserving fine structures in images, we can recover sharp depth boundaries. Experiments on three images containing color bleeding areas demonstrate that our method achieves much high-quality results compared with the existing random walks (RW) based methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2359643","Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:LQ12D01001,LQ12F03001,LQ14A040006,LY12F01001); Educational Commission of Zhejiang Province of China(grant numbers:Y201431834); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906293","2D-to-3D conversion;depth boundaries;depth-map;nonlocal neighbors;nonlocal random walks","Vectors;Signal processing algorithms;Image edge detection;Equations;Materials;Color;Mathematical model","","15","","17","IEEE","22 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
