In this letter, a special synchronization sequence with non-continuous spectrum is constructed and can be evaluated at the receiver with a modified version of the Park algorithm.

At the second stage, the compensated image is produced by adaptively obtaining the compensation coefficient for each subband based on the referred Gaussian template. The experimental results indicated that the compensated image quality was higher than that of the original image.

The proposed technique exploits the real property of transmitted symbols to blindly identify the channel-induced rotation in the received signal, thereby reducing the pilot overhead for estimation purpose. Specifically, the channel phase over each subcarrier can be obtained from the spatial-sign covariance matrix of the received signal, while the channel amplitude can be expressed in terms of the subcarrier power. In effect, the frequency-domain noise can be reduced effectively by block averaging over multiple symbols. Since the channel delay spread is usually much smaller than the symbol duration, channel coefficients obtained from the estimated phase and amplitude can be further refined through low-rank filtering.

We investigate the optimal power allocation and power splitting ratio to maximize the sum-rate of the uplink and downlink transmissions.

The proposed algorithm is obtained by first developing a model of the constant modulus (CM) criterion and then fitting that model into the Kalman filter-style state space model by using an auxiliary parameter. The proposed algorithm does not require a priori information about the process noise and measurement noise covariance matrices and hence it can be applied readily. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm offers improved performance compared to the recursive least square-based CM (RLS-CMA) and least-mean square-based CM (LMS-CMA) algorithms for adaptive blind beamforming.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2362932","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6922488","Blind beamforming;constant modulus;state space model;unscented Kalman filter","Kalman filters;Signal processing algorithms;Noise;Vectors;Array signal processing;Adaptation models;Direction-of-arrival estimation","","34","","16","IEEE","14 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We extend this approach to filterbanks with the constraint that transform domain signal components must be uncorrelated. Our analysis shows that filterbanks based on Vandermonde decomposition of the autocorrelation matrix correspond to the non-uniform discrete Fourier transform and satisfies the MVDR criteria. Namely, the columns of the inverse Vandermonde matrix corresponds to filters with unit response at the pass-band while leakage is minimized with the constraint that components remain uncorrelated. In the special case that the autocorrelation matrix is rank deficient, the proposed filterbank coincides with Pisarenko's harmonic decomposition, which thus also satisfies the MVDR criteria.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2363234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6926762","Minimum-variance distortionless response;Pisarenko‚Äôs harmonic decomposition;time-frequency transform;Vandermonde transform","Correlation;Discrete Fourier transforms;Decorrelation;Matrix decomposition;Time-frequency analysis;Harmonic analysis","","3","","20","IEEE","16 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This practice leads to superior end performance to designing the experiment with respect to some generic metric quantifying the distance of the estimated model from the true one. This is usually done by choosing and fixing the estimation method to either a standard maximum likelihood (ML) or a Bayesian estimator. In this paper, we pose the intuitive question: Can we design better estimators than the usual ones with respect to an end performance metric of interest? Based on a simple linear regression example we affirmatively answer this question.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2363464","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6926736","End performance metric;estimation;experiment design;training","Measurement;Training;Maximum likelihood estimation;Vectors;Modeling;Standards","","","","17","IEEE","16 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Similar to cloud radio access networks in communications, the receive antennas quantize the received baseband signal before transmitting it to the FC. The problem of maximizing the detection performance at the FC jointly over the code vector used by the transmitting antenna and over the statistics of the noise introduced by backhaul quantization is investigated. Specifically, adopting the information-theoretic criterion of the Bhattacharyya distance to evaluate the detection performance at the FC and information-theoretic measures of the quantization rate, the problem at hand is addressed via a Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) method coupled with Majorization-Minimization (MM). Numerical results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed joint optimization approach over more conventional solutions that perform separate optimization.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2363939","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6928422","Cloud processing;detection;information-theory;multistatic radar;quantization","Receiving antennas;Vectors;Quantization (signal);Radar;Sensors;Covariance matrices;Clutter","","26","","17","IEEE","17 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, FIC suffers from high computational cost in searching local self-similarities in natural image. Although many papers aiming at speeding up FIC have been published, they use pre-processing tools or approximation methods. Reducing the intrinsic computational complexity of FIC is still an open problem. Since quantum mechanics based Grover's quantum search algorithm (QSA) is able to achieve square-root speedup over classical algorithms in unsorted database searching, we propose an interdisciplinary approach by using Grover's QSA to reduce the intrinsic computational complexity of FIC in this letter. In particular, both domain blocks and range blocks are represented as quantum states, then Grover's QSA is employed to search the most similar domain block for each range block under the criterion of maximizing quantum fidelity between these two kinds of quantum states. Without sacrificing compression ratio, experimental results show that the execution time of the proposed method is 100 times shorter than that of the baseline FIC. Moreover, retrieved images from our proposal are also less distorted than those from other state-of-the-art FIC approaches.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2363689","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61175012,61201421); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6928466","Fractal image compression (FIC);grover‚Äôs quantum search algorithm (QSA);quantum acceleration","Image coding;Fractals;Signal processing algorithms;Quantum computing;Quantum mechanics;Time complexity","","16","","21","IEEE","17 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A new dynamic texture sequence is classified to the category by determining whether it is the most similar to this category with the probability that the observed sequence is produced by the HMMs of the training samples. The experimental results demonstrate the arbitrary emission probability distribution and the higher-order dependence of hidden states of a higher-order HMM result in better classification performance, as compared with the linear dynamical system (LDS) based method.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2362613","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61371175); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6919279","Classification;dynamic texture;HMM;LDS","Hidden Markov models;Dynamics;Autoregressive processes;Training;Probability distribution;Heuristic algorithms;Markov processes","","31","","12","IEEE","9 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
