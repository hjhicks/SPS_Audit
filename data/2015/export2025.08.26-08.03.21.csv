These problems are caused by applying the frequency-independent ICPD without considering the acoustic transfer paths of the system setup. To solve these problems, first, the interaural cues of ear signals are analyzed by binaural auditory simulations. Then, stereophonic ADR filters are designed that produce ear signals with a linearly controlled interaural cross-correlation (IACC) and a consistent interaural level difference (IALD) for sophisticated distance perception under the given stereo setup.

In the training phase, we first construct local optimization for each training sample according to the relationship of neighboring data points. The local optimization aims to: (1) ensure the consistency for each LR face image and corresponding HR one; (2) model the intrinsic geometric structure between each given sample and its neighbors; and (3) preserve the discriminative information across different subjects.

"A Unified Regularization Framework for Virtual Frontal Face Image Synthesis","Y. Hao; C.

However, the existing methods mainly utilize either ordinary least squares (OLS) or fixed ${l_1}$ –norm penalized sparse regression to estimate the solution. For the former, the solution is unstable when the linear equations system is ill-conditioned. For the latter, sparsity is only considered, while the significance of local similarity between input image and each training sample is ignored. Thus the synthesized result fails to faithfully approximate the ground truth. Moreover, these traditional methods cannot ensure the consistency between corresponding patches in frontal and profile faces. To address these problems, we present a unified regularization framework (URF) by imposing two regularization terms onto the solution. Firstly, we introduce an ${l_2}$-norm constraint and impose a diagonal weights matrix onto it, in which each diagonal entry is defined by the spatial distance between input image patch and individual patch in training set. Secondly, to mitigate the aforementioned inconsistency problem, we present a neighborhood consistency regularization term, motivated by manifold learning. Finally, we generalize our framework to the ${l_q}$-norm penalized case. By adjusting the shrinkage parameter  $q$, the framework gets more flexibility to choose a reasonable sparse domain. Extensive experiments on CMU Multi-PIE database and CAS-PEAL-R1 database verify the efficacy of our method.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2364185","Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China(grant numbers:20110201110012); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6932464","Face synthesis (fs);manifold learning (ml);sparse representation (sr)","Face;Manifolds;Image generation;Least squares approximations;Training;Active appearance model;Solid modeling","","8","","45","IEEE","21 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper introduces a simple but effective attack technique capable to defeat a PRH fingerprint-based audio copy detector without significantly affecting the signal quality. It is a heuristic method that adds a suitable distortion to the original audio signal, so that the modified signal is not detected as a copy of the original one but is perceptively very similar to it.

Second-order properties of the intrinsic mode functions are used to form a null hypothesis, which indicates the absence of target(s) if accepted. Extensive experiments on real-world radar data show that the proposed radar scene analysis procedure leads to significantly enhanced statistical separability for target+clutter and clutter-alone data. The results are judged from an information-theoretic perspective using the Kullback-Leibler distance as well as by visual inspection.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2365361","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6936903","Bayesian target tracking;bivariate empirical mode decomposition;cognitive radar;fractals;fractional Gaussian noise;Kullback–Leibler distance;McMaster IPIX radar;radar scene analysis;relative entropy;sea clutter","Clutter;Radar tracking;Radar remote sensing;Empirical mode decomposition;Radar clutter;Indexes","","7","","28","IEEE","27 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The problem of distributed detection is formulated as a binary hypothesis test at the fusion center (FC) based on 1-bit data sent by the sensors. Adopting Chernoff information as our performance metric, we study the detection performance of the system under Byzantine attack in the asymptotic regime. The expression for minimum attacking power required by the Byzantines to blind the FC is obtained. More specifically, we show that above a certain fraction of Byzantine attackers in the network, the detection scheme becomes completely incapable of utilizing the sensor data for detection. When the fraction of Byzantines is not sufficient to blind the FC, we also provide closed form expressions for the optimal attacking strategies for the Byzantines that most degrade the detection performance.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2365196","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6936865","Bayesian detection;byzantine data;chernoff information;data falsification;distributed detection","Distributed databases;Bayes methods;Measurement;Educational institutions;Sensor fusion;Closed-form solutions","","35","","18","IEEE","27 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The features are based on sample mean and sample variance of the imaginary part of the product of two consecutive complex signal values. Root raised cosine pulses are used to generate the linearly modulated signals. Support vector machines are employed to distinguish the signals. One benefit of using support vector machines is that it requires very few realizations for training. Moreover, no a priori information is required about carrier amplitude, carrier phase, carrier offset, symbol rate, pulse shape, initial symbol phase (timing offset) and channel impulse response. Effectiveness of the features and signal separation by support vector machines is tested by observing the joint effects of additive white Gaussian noise, carrier offset, lack of symbol and sampling synchronization, and either fast or slow fading. In the course of doing that, the proposed classifier is compared to the wavelet based classifier, equipped by support vector machines.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2363615","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6924714","Digital modulation separation;root raised cosine pulses;support vector machines;wavelet","Frequency shift keying;Quadrature amplitude modulation;Support vector machines;Binary phase shift keying","","12","","8","IEEE","15 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the conventional OFDM systems the insertion of a cyclic prefix (CP) decreases the system's spectral efficiency. As an alternative to OFDM, filter bank based multicarrier systems adopt proper pulse shaping with good time and frequency localisation properties to avoid interference and maintain orthogonality in real field among sub-carriers without the use of CP. We evaluate the spectral efficiency of OFDM/OQAM systems with IOTA pulse shaping in comparison with conventional OFDM/QAM systems, and our analytical model is further extended in order to gain insights into the effect of utilizing the intrinsic interference on the performance of our system. Furthermore, the spectral efficiency of OFDM/OQAM systems is analyzed when the effect of inter-symbol and inter-carrier interference is considered.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2364898","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6934966","Intrinsic interference;OFDM/OQAM","OFDM;Interference;Pulse shaping methods;Signal to noise ratio;Time-frequency analysis;Quadrature amplitude modulation","","33","","25","IEEE","23 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The algorithm computes for each target pixel varying contributions from reliable depth seeds, and weighted averaging is used to interpolate missing depths. Compared with state-of-the-art joint geodesic upsampling method which selects the K nearest seeds to interpolate missing depths with O(Kn) complexity, our method does not need to limit the number of seeds to K and reduces the computational complexity to O(n). In addition, the minimax path chooses a path with the smallest maximum immediate pairwise pixel difference on it, so it tends to preserve sharp depth discontinuities better. In contrast to the results of previous depth upsampling algorithms, our approach can provide accurate depths with fewer artifacts.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2365527","the open funding project of State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems Beihang University(grant numbers:BUAA-VR-14KF-10); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61271430,61331018,61332017,91338202); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6937140","Depth map;minimax path;upsampling","Interpolation;Reliability;Signal processing algorithms;Joints;Complexity theory;Image color analysis;Image edge detection","","6","1","22","IEEE","28 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For scenarios when the micro-motion of radar target is accompanied by macro-motion, the periodicity of m-D is disturbed by macro-motion. In that case, extraction of micro-motion signatures based on the periodicity of time-frequency representation (TFR) of the radar echo may become invalid. In this work, we show that the periodicity of TFR is replaced by circular periodicity in the presence of macro-motion. In view of this, the circular correlation coefficients of TFR are employed to characterize the circular periodicity of TFR and to provide an estimate of the micro-motion period. The property of circular correlation coefficients enables us to estimate the micro-motion period of radar targets in the presence of macro-motion. Experiments with synthetic data and measured radar data validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2365547","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:60872134,61201334,61302147); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6937134","Circular correlation coefficients;macro-motion;micro-motion;parameter estimation;time-frequency representation","Radar;Correlation coefficient;Time-frequency analysis;Feature extraction;Radar scattering;Frequency modulation","","47","","16","IEEE","28 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An efficient algorithm for recovery of a sparse input from the STFT magnitude is then suggested, based on an adaptation of the recently proposed GESPAR algorithm.
