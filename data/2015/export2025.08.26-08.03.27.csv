The proposed method is based on a Markov random walk model that performs a simultaneous random walk on two graphs. Unlike previous random walk models, the proposed random walker examines the neighboring nodes at each step and adjusts its mode of random walk, where it can switch between a simultaneous walk on both graphs and an individual walk on one of the two graphs.

However, so far these studies have focused mainly on basic features of the Electroencephalography. In this study we propose an approach based on phase synchronization, to investigate personal distinctive brain network organization. To this end, the importance, in terms of centrality, of different regions was determined on the basis of EEG recordings. We hypothesized that nodal centrality enables the accurate identification of individuals. EEG signals from a cohort of 109 64-channels EEGs were band-pass filtered in the classical frequency bands and functional connectivity between the sensors was estimated using the Phase Lag Index. The resulting connectivity matrix was used to construct a weighted network, from which the nodal Eigenvector Centrality was computed. Nodal centrality was successively used as feature vector. Highest recognition rates were observed in the gamma band (equal error rate ( EER) = 0.044) and high beta band ( EER = 0.102). Slightly lower recognition rate was observed in the low beta band ( EER = 0.144), while poor recognition rates were observed for the others frequency bands. The reported results show that resting-state functional brain network topology provides better classification performance than using only a measure of functional connectivity, and may represent an optimal solution for the design of next generation EEG based biometric systems. This study also suggests that results from biometric systems based on high-frequency scalp EEG features should be interpreted with caution.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2367091","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6945793","Biometrics;centrality;EEG;networks","Electroencephalography;Biometrics (access control);Brain;Network topology;Pollution measurement;Organizations;Band-pass filters","","134","","36","IEEE","4 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When multimodal data are considered (i.e. multi-set or multi-kind), some joint analysis are needed, for instance multi-set canonical correlation analysis or independent vector analysis. However, these methods only consider unidimensional sources in each set/modality. In this letter, an approach for dealing with multidimensional sources in each modality is derived. It assumes that the underlying dimensions in each modality for each source are known and it is based on a piecewise second order stationary model. Based on the likelihood, a contrast function is derived for the Gaussian case and is shown to be a constrained joint block decomposition of covariance matrices. Numerical simulations exhibit the merit of using a few number of modalities: it improves the quality of the separation and reduces the variance on the estimates. Finally, the proposed method outperforms the multi-set canonical correlation analysis and the independent component analysis applied to each individual modality followed by a clustering.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2367158","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6945835","Blind source separation;joint block matrix decomposition;multidimensional signals;multimodal data","Joints;Blind source separation;Vectors;Sensors;Covariance matrices;Numerical models","","5","","17","IEEE","4 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Dosiek","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Schenectady, NY, USA",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,"12 Nov 2014","2015","22","6","691","695","Electric power system instantaneous frequency, also referred to as electrical network frequency (ENF), pollutes digital recordings due to a variety of factors (e.g., transformer hum). This unwanted interference has been used as a forensic tool in conjunction with a database of ground truth ENF measurements to determine the time at which a recording was made, as well as to detect tampering. Recent work has suggested that that ENF could be used to geolocate a digital recording under the assumption that the low-energy location-unique power system dynamics are observable, which is not always the case in the presence of noise and interference. This letter aims to take advantage of the intrinsic nature of power system instantaneous frequency in order to frame the ENF extraction problem as one of FM demodulation. By considering the ENF as a sinusoid of nominal power system frequency that is frequency modulated by a weak stochastic signal, a 0-Hz Intermediate Frequency (IF) signal can be created and analyzed rather than direct measurements. In doing so, significant data reduction can be achieved through extensive downsampling, FM demodulation algorithms can be applied to extract the ENF, and the spectrum of the IF signal provides a straightforward way of estimating the maximum observable frequency content of the ENF buried in a digital recording. These findings are supported through the analysis of audio recordings made in the presence of ENF interference in the U.S. Eastern Interconnection power system.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2368516","Air Force Office of Scientific Research(grant numbers:FA9550-12-1-0229); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6949608","Digital forensics;ENF;FM;geolocation","Frequency modulation;Power system dynamics;Digital recording;Interference;Frequency estimation","","25","1","19","IEEE","7 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Exact and asymptotic behaviours of the received SINR are derived for both general and interference limited scenarios over general fading environment.

We propose a Bayesian framework to extend current Steady State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) classifiers to a maximum a posteriori (MAP) classifiers by using a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) to learn the distribution of features conditioned on stimulation class. To demonstrate our framework we extend Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Power Spectral Density (PSD) style methods. Traditionally, in either example, the class is estimated as the class associated with the maximum feature. Our framework increases performance by relaxing the assumption that a stimulation class's sample often maximizes its class-associated feature. Further, by leveraging the KDE, we present a method which estimates the performance of a classifier under different stimulation frequency sets. Using this, we optimize the selection of stimulation frequencies from those present in a training set.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2368952","Division of Information and Intelligent Systems(grant numbers:1118061,1149570); Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences(grant numbers:1027724); National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:5R01DC009834); SBE Office of Multidisciplinary Activities(grant numbers:0835976); Division of Computer and Network Systems(grant numbers:1136027); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6951348","Brain Computer Interfaces;CCA;EDICS: BIO-BCI;information Transfer Rate;kernel Density Estimation;SAS-STAT;SSVEP","Harmonic analysis;Frequency estimation;Electroencephalography;Accuracy;Correlation;Power system harmonics;Vectors","","11","","28","IEEE","10 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Standard vector autoregressive (VAR) models fail to estimate reliably networks with large number of nodes. We propose a new method based on factor modeling for reliable and efficient high-dimensional VAR analysis of large networks. We develop a subspace VAR (SVAR) model from a factor model (FM), where observations are driven by a lower-dimensional subspace of common latent factors with an AR dynamics. We consider two variants of principal components (PC) methods that provide consistent estimates for the FM hence the implied SVAR model, even of large dimensions. Information criterion is used to select the optimal subspace dimension. We established asymptotic normality and convergence rates for the estimated SVAR coefficients matrix. Evaluation on simulated resting-state fMRI shows that the SVAR models are more robust and produce better connectivity estimates than the classical model for a moderately-large network analysis. Results on real data by varying the subspace dimensions identify strong connections in the default mode network and reveal hierarchical connectivity of resting-state networks with distinct functional relevance.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2365634","Universiti Teknologi Malaysia(grant numbers:GUP Tier 1 Q.J130000.254); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6939665","Brain effective connectivity;factor model;fMRI;vector autoregressive model","Brain modeling;Reactive power;Load modeling;Estimation;Frequency modulation;Vectors;Reliability","","22","","33","IEEE","29 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The key idea is to progressively perform feature matching based on Vector Field Consensus, and hence greatly boost the number of true matches as well as avoid false matches. More specifically, it uses matching results on a small putative correspondence set with high inlier ratio to guide the matching on a large putative correspondence set which probably covers the whole true correspondences. We model the transformation between images in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and a sparse approximation is applied to the transformation to avoid high computational complexity. Our results quantitatively show that our PVFC outperforms state-of-the-art methods, both in accuracy and in efficiency.

Usually, a target matrix is chosen and optimization of the shrinkage factor is carried out, based on some relevant metric. In this letter, we rather address the choice of the target matrix. More precisely, we aim at evaluating, from observation of the data matrix, whether a given target matrix is a good regularizer. Towards this end, the expected likelihood (EL) approach is investigated. At a first step, we re-interpret the regularized covariance matrix estimate as the minimum mean-square error estimate in a Bayesian model where the target matrix serves as a prior. The likelihood function of the data is then derived, and the EL principle is subsequently applied. Over-sampled and under-sampled scenarios are considered.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2369232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6951419","Covariance matrix estimation;expected likelihood;regularization","Covariance matrices;Bayes methods;Signal to noise ratio;Estimation;Mean square error methods;Loading","","18","1","29","IEEE","10 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
