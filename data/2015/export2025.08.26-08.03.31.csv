In the first step, pairwise superpixel grouping is conducted in four orientations. Grouping prototypes containing the prior information of foreground and background are generated to determine whether any pair of neighboring superpixels should be grouped together. In the second step, superpixels selected by the first step are grouped into a single region which serves as the object region. The proposed grouping method has two benefits over the state-of-the-art ones. First, pairwise grouping is independently conducted in four orientations, which exploits the local structure of the foregound/backgroud and facilitates a more robust grouping process. Second, rather than considering the similarity of two neighboring superpixels, the grouping process is performed via accounting for the prior information of the object and the background, which is more suitable for visual tracking. Many experiments on challenging video clips demonstrate that our method achieves good performance than the state-of-the-art trackers in a wide range of tracking scenarios.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2014.2369476,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6952967,Sparse representation;structural grouping;visual tracking,Prototypes;Visualization;Training;Image color analysis;Signal processing algorithms;Educational institutions;Materials,,10,,21,IEEE,11 Nov 2014,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

However, these techniques are seldom successful in even obtaining a feasible solution when the QCQP matrices are indefinite. In this letter, a new feasible point pursuit successive convex approximation (FPP-SCA) algorithm is proposed for non-convex QCQPs.

Finally, we employ a simple moving average filter to smooth the MCLA image sequence to further improve the denoising performance and stability. Experiments indicate that the NLM-ST outperforms the classic patchwise NLM and three other well-known recent variants in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM), and visual quality.

However, the R-lambda model fails to consider the frame-content complexity that ultimately degrades the performance of the bit rate control. In this letter, a gradient based R-lambda (GRL) model is proposed for the intra frame rate control, where the gradient can effectively measure the frame-content complexity and enhance the performance of the traditional R-lambda method.

However, the formation of the margin in these methods is not scalable, and thus cannot adequately use inter-class information according to the relevant practical application.

The approach is illustrated by trending the 10-year extreme event risks for S&P 500 index daily losses and for peak power load in electrical utility data.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2014.2378787,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6980088,,Market research;Computational modeling;Indexes;Bayes methods;Maximum likelihood estimation;Educational institutions,,6,,28,OAPA,9 Dec 2014,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals
Fast Digital Filtering of Spectrometric Data for Pile-up Correction,T. Trigano; E. Barat; T. Dautremer; T. Montagu,"Department of Electrical Engineering, Shamoon College of Engineering, Ashdod, Israel; CEA, LIST, Gif sur Yvette, France; CEA, LIST, Gif sur Yvette, France; CEA, LIST, Gif sur Yvette, France",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,18 Dec 2014,2015,22,7,973,977,"This letter considers a problem stemming from the analysis of spectrometric data. When performing experiments on highly radioactive matter, electrical pulses recorded by the spectrometer tend to overlap, thus yielding severe distortions when computing the histogram of the pulses’ energies. In this letter, we propose a fast recursive algorithm which estimates efficiently this histogram from measurements of the duration and energies of overlapping pulses. Its good performances are shown both on simulations and real data. Furthermore, its lower algorithmic complexity makes it more fitting for real-time implementation.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2014.2377352,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6975112,Digital signal processing;nonlinear inverse problem;pile-up correction;signal restoration and enhancement,Signal processing algorithms;Mathematical model;Nonlinear distortion;Histograms;Photonics;Real-time systems;Detectors,,13,,8,IEEE,4 Dec 2014,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals
A Time Regularization Technique for Discrete Spectral Envelopes Through Frequency Derivative,G. Degottex,"University of Crete and FORTH, Heraklion, Greece",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,18 Dec 2014,2015,22,7,978,982,"In most applications of sinusoidal models for speech signal, an amplitude spectral envelope is necessary. This envelope is not only assumed to fit the vocal tract filter response as accurately as possible, but it should also exhibit slow varying shapes across time. Indeed, time irregularities can generate artifacts in signal manipulations or increase improperly the features variance used in statistical models. In this letter, a simple technique is suggested to improve this time regularity. Considering that time regularity is characterized by slowly varying spectral shapes among successive frames, the basic idea is to smooth the frequency derivative of the envelope instead of its absolute value. Even though, this idea could be applied to different envelope models, the present letter describes its application to the simple linear interpolation envelope. Using real speech signals, the evaluation shows that the time irregularity can be drastically reduced. Additional experiments using synthetic signals also show that the accuracy of the original envelope is not degraded by the process.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2014.2380412,"Swiss National Science Foundation(grant numbers:PBSKP2_140021); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6980109,Amplitude spectral envelope;sinusoidal model;speech modeling;time regularity,Harmonic analysis;Time-frequency analysis;Cepstral analysis;Hidden Markov models;Speech;Shape;Frequency estimation,,2,,24,IEEE,9 Dec 2014,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals
Performance Analysis of Time of Arrival Estimation on OFDM Signals,M. Driusso; M. Comisso; F. Babich; C. Marshall,"Department of Engineering and Architecture, University of Trieste, Italy; Department of Engineering and Architecture, University of Trieste, Italy; Department of Engineering and Architecture, University of Trieste, Italy; u-blox UK Ltd, Reigate, United Kingdom",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,18 Dec 2014,2015,22,7,983,987,"This letter characterizes the error performance of realistically modelled orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals, when their time of arrival has to be estimated in an additive white Gaussian noise channel. In particular, different power distributions on the available sub-carriers of the OFDM signal are considered, and bounds on the corresponding root mean square estimation error (RMSEE) are evaluated. The tools used for such purpose are the widely adopted Cramér-Rao bound and the Ziv-Zakai bound, which is tight in a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. The presented analysis reveals that, for a given signal bandwidth, a proper power distribution on the OFDM sub-carriers is crucial for achieving a good performance in the low to medium SNR region, where the RMSEE curve exhibits the typical threshold behavior. Moreover, a trade-off between asymptotic and threshold performance is identified, thanks to the adoption of a novel performance figure, which directly describes the threshold RMSEE behavior.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2014.2378994,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6979218,Cramér-Rao bound;OFDM;root mean square;time of arrival estimation;Ziv-Zakai bound,OFDM;Power distribution;Time of arrival estimation;Bandwidth;Signal to noise ratio;Root mean square;Estimation,,18,,20,IEEE,8 Dec 2014,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals
Empirical Non-Parametric Estimation of the Fisher Information,V. Berisha; A. O. Hero,"Department of Speech and Hearing Science, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science(EECS), Ann Arbor, MI",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,18 Dec 2014,2015,22,7,988,992,"The Fisher information matrix (FIM) is a foundational concept in statistical signal processing. The FIM depends on the probability distribution, assumed to belong to a smooth parametric family. Traditional approaches to estimating the FIM require estimating the probability distribution function (PDF), or its parameters, along with its gradient or Hessian. However, in many practical situations the PDF of the data is not known but the statistician has access to an observation sample for any parameter value. Here we propose a method of estimating the FIM directly from sampled data that does not require knowledge of the underlying PDF. The method is based on non-parametric estimation of an f-divergence over a local neighborhood of the parameter space and a relation between curvature of the f-divergence and the FIM. Thus we obtain an empirical estimator of the FIM that does not require density estimation and is asymptotically consistent. We empirically evaluate the validity of our approach using two experiments.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2014.2378514,"National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CCF-1217880); Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-11-1-0391); Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N000141410722); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6975144,Cochlear implant modeling;Cramer-Rao lower bound;empirical Fisher information;$f$-divergence;graph signal processing,Estimation;Probability density function;Educational institutions;Density measurement;Least squares approximations;Vectors;Signal processing,,36,,22,IEEE,4 Dec 2014,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

The bit LLR for the maximum likelihood (ML) and the linear minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) receivers are derived, showing in both receivers explicit scaling of the LLR that is a function of the QAM symbol and the CEE variance. These new expressions for the LLRs are used to show that only modest improvements in the link performance are achieved relative to the LLRs that do not take into account the CEE. This indicates that separating the detector design from channel estimation does not significantly impact the system performance, which leads to simplifications in the overall receiver implementation.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2014.2374425,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6967799,Channel estimation error;log-likelihood ratio;maximum likelihood;MIMO;MMSE;QAM,Receivers;Channel estimation;Vectors;Quadrature amplitude modulation;MIMO;Measurement;Detectors,,15,,19,IEEE,26 Nov 2014,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals
