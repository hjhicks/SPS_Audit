"Can we Automatically Transform Speech Recorded on Common Consumer Devices in Real-World Environments into Professional Production Quality Speech?—A Dataset, Insights, and Challenges","G. J. Mysore","Adobe Research, San Francisco, CA, USA",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,"19 Dec 2014","2015","22","8","1006","1010","The goal of speech enhancement is typically to recover clean speech from noisy, reverberant, and often bandlimited speech in order to yield improved intelligibility, clarity, or automatic speech recognition performance. However, the acoustic goal for a great deal of speech content such as voice overs, podcasts, demo videos, lecture videos, and audio stories is often not merely clean speech, but speech that is aesthetically pleasing. This is achieved in professional recording studios by having a skilled sound engineer record clean speech in an acoustically treated room and then edit and process it with audio effects (which we refer to as production). A growing amount of speech content is being recorded on common consumer devices such as tablets, smartphones, and laptops. Moreover, it is typically recorded in common but non-acoustically treated environments such as homes and offices. We argue that the goal of enhancing such recordings should not only be to make it sound cleaner as would be done using traditional speech enhancement techniques, but to make it sound like it was recorded and produced in a professional recording studio. In this paper, we show why this can be beneficial, describe a new data set (a great deal of which was recorded in a professional recording studio) that we prepared to help in developing algorithms for this purpose, and discuss some insights and challenges associated with this problem.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2379648","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6981922","Automatic production;speech enhancement","Speech;Speech enhancement;Production;Signal processing algorithms;Performance evaluation;Acoustics","","47","1","25","IEEE","10 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Improper choice of any of these may result in increased computational burden and/or unresolved frequency components. This paper presents an analytical approach to determine expressions of lobe width using Fs and N at lobe base (Δfb) and half of the lobe height (Δfh). The required values of Fs and N can be derived from the expression of Δfb for distortion-less lobe heights of two closely spaced sinusoids. A tighter bound can be found using the expression of only Δfh to resolve two distinct peaks. Probability of resolution using reciprocal of MUSIC peaks is determined for various N and it's limit for full resolvability was verified with the derived analytical expressions.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2366638","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6942180","Autocorrelation matrix;closely spaced sinusoids;detectability;matrix perturbation;music;subspaces","Correlation;Noise;Multiple signal classification;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Signal resolution;Signal processing algorithms;Symmetric matrices","","21","","20","IEEE","31 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on statistical changepoint detection methodology, we develop three algorithms: the Exhaustive Search (ES), the Mixture, and the Hierarchical Mixture (H-Mix) methods. Performance of these methods is evaluated by the average run length (ARL), which captures the frequency of false alarms, and the detection delay. Numerical comparisons show that the ES method performs the best; however, it is exponentially complex. The Mixture method is polynomially complex by exploiting the fact that the size of the community is typically small in a large network. However, it may react to a group of active edges that do not form a community. This issue is resolved by the H-Mix method, which is based on a dendrogram decomposition of the network. We present an asymptotic analytical expression for ARL of the Mixture method when the threshold is large.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2381553","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6985719","Changepoint detection;community detection;sequential methods;social networks","Communities;Image edge detection;Signal processing algorithms;Delays;Social network services;Electronic mail;Testing","","10","","19","IEEE","18 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The results also confirm how 3D surface detection methods avoid missing surface information by successfully locating complete boundaries irrespective of the object orientation and plane of image capture.

The amount of feed is initially detected using the correlation filer applied to an optimum local region within the video frame, and then followed by a SVM-based refinement classifier to suppress the falsely detected feed.

Primary-ambient extraction (PAE) is one of the key approaches to facilitate flexible and optimal rendering in spatial audio reproduction. Existing approaches, such as principal component analysis and time-frequency masking, often suffer from severe extraction error. This problem is more evident when the sound scene contains a relatively strong ambient component, which is frequently encountered in digital media. In this Letter, we propose a novel PAE approach by estimating the ambient phase with a sparsity constraint (APES). This approach exploits the equal magnitude of the uncorrelated ambient components in the two channels of a stereo signal and reformulates the PAE problem as an ambient phase estimation problem, which is then solved using the criterion that the primary component is sparse.

By taking into account the nonlinear structures, it is more effective to estimate the combination coefficients in the kernel feature space. Furthermore, a pixel-based model is also employed according to the characteristics of face images, which is useful to compensate the local textures. The final HR face images are obtained from a global optimization function by an iterative process. Experimental results show the advantage of the proposed approach in both reconstruction error and visual quality.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2390972","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7006661","Face hallucination;global optimization;kernel method;regularization prior","Face;Training;Image reconstruction;Kernel;Optimization;Databases;PSNR","","11","","22","IEEE","12 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared with the original derivation, which exploits central limit theorem and Taylor expansion to simplify belief propagation (BP), our derivation resorts to expectation propagation (EP) and the neglect of high-order terms in large system limit. This alternative derivation leads to a different yet provably equivalent form of message passing, which explicitly establishes the intrinsic connection between AMP and EP, thereby offering some new insights in the understanding and improvement of AMP.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2391287","Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program(grant numbers:20131089219); National Basic Research Program of China(grant numbers:2013CB329001); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:91338101,91438206); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7008468","Approximate message passing;compressed sensing;expectation propagation;linear mixing","Message passing;Signal processing algorithms;Approximation algorithms;Minimization;Random variables;Density functional theory;Taylor series","","46","","20","IEEE","13 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"An Efficient Jacobi-Like Deflationary ICA Algorithm: Application to EEG Denoising","S. H. Sardouie; L. Albera; M. B. Shamsollahi; I.

More particularly, while a projection-based deflation scheme inspired by Delfosse and Loubaton's ICA technique ( DelL\BBR) is used, a Jacobi-like optimization strategy is proposed in order to maximize a fourth order cumulant-based contrast built from whitened observations. Experimental results obtained from simulated epileptic EEG data mixed with a real muscular activity and from the comparison in terms of performance and numerical complexity with the FastICA, RobustICA and DelL\BBR algorithms, show that the proposed algorithm offers the best trade-off between performance and numerical complexity when a low number ( ~ 12) of electrodes is available.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2385868","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997991","Deflation;denoising;ElectroEncephaloGraphy;higher order statistics;independent component analysis;interictal epileptic data;Jacobi-like optimization","Signal processing algorithms;Jacobian matrices;Electroencephalography;Complexity theory;Electrodes;Vectors;Robustness","","15","","10","IEEE","24 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
