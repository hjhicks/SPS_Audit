In this letter, a new and efficient image features descriptor based on the local diagonal extrema pattern (LDEP) is proposed for CT image retrieval. The proposed approach finds the values and indexes of the local diagonal extremas to exploit the relationship among the diagonal neighbors of any center pixel of the image using first-order local diagonal derivatives. The intensity values of the local diagonal extremas are compared with the intensity value of the center pixel to utilize the relationship of central pixel with its neighbors. Finally, the descriptor is formed on the basis of the indexes and comparison of center pixel and local diagonal extremas. The consideration of only diagonal neighbors greatly reduces the dimension of the feature vector which speeds up the image retrieval task and solves the “Curse of dimensionality” problem also. The LDEP is tested for CT image retrieval over Emphysema-CT and NEMA-CT databases and compared with the existing approaches. The superiority in terms of performance and efficiency in terms of speedup of the proposed method are confirmed by the experiments.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2392623","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7009996","CT image retrieval;LBP;local diagonal neighbors;Local features;LTCoP;LTP;medical image","Image retrieval;Indexes;Computed tomography;Biomedical imaging;Feature extraction;Medical services;Vectors","","112","","27","IEEE","14 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A stochastic Gabor filter realized using the stochastic sine shaper and a stochastic exponential function is simulated and compared with the original Gabor filter that shows almost equivalent behaviour at various frequencies and variance. A root-mean-square error of 0.043 at most is observed.

Many algorithms have already been proposed to recover such non-negative representations, where greedy and convex relaxed algorithms are among the most popular methods. The greedy techniques have been modified to incorporate the non-negativity of the representations. One such modification has been proposed for Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), which first chooses positive coefficients and uses a non-negative optimisation technique as a replacement for the orthogonal projection onto the selected support. Beside the extra computational costs of the optimisation program, it does not benefit from the fast implementation techniques of OMP. These fast implementations are based on the matrix factorisations. We here first investigate the problem of positive representation, using pursuit algorithms. We will then describe a new implementation, which can fully incorporate the positivity constraint of the coefficients, throughout the selection stage of the algorithm. As a result, we present a novel fast implementation of the Non-Negative OMP, which is based on the QR decomposition and an iterative coefficients update. We will empirically show that such a modification can easily accelerate the implementation by a factor of ten in a reasonable size problem.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2393637","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/K014277/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7012095","Matching Pursuit;non-negative least square and spectral decomposition;non-negative sparse approximations;orthogonal matching pursuit;QR matrix factorisation","Matching pursuit algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Least squares approximations;Matrix decomposition;Dictionaries;Educational institutions","","80","","14","IEEE","16 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The latest theory within the CS framework analyzes the local coherence between the Fourier and wavelet bases, and recover the signal from frequencies randomly selected according to a variable density profile. Unlike these developments, we adopt a new approach that does not need to analyze the (local) coherence. We show that the problem can be tackled by recovering the wavelet coefficients from the finest to the coarse scale, and only a small set of frequencies are needed to recover the coefficients exactly. As long as the scaling function satisfies a mild condition, the reconstruction is exact. Moreover the frequency set can be deterministically pre-selected and does not need to change even if the wavelet basis changes.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2393953","European Research Council(grant numbers:starting investigator award Nr. 277800 (RecoSamp)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014264","Compressive Sensing;Fourier transform;wavelet","Wavelet transforms;Fourier transforms;Coherence;Sensors;Compressed sensing;Wavelet analysis;Standards","","7","","20","OAPA","19 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In compressed sensing (CS), recovery rates have been improved substantially with optimized projections; however, these techniques do not produce binary matrices, which are more suitable for hardware implementation. In this paper, we consider an underdetermined linear system with sparse solutions and propose a preconditioning technique that yields a system matrix having the properties of an incoherent unit norm tight frame. While existing work in preconditioning concerns greedy algorithms, the proposed technique is based on recent theoretical results for standard numerical solvers such as BP and OMP.

The proposed scheme consists of an information sharing stage and a cooperative transmission stage. Specifically, in the information sharing stage the source informs the helper of the signal to be transmitted, while in the cooperative transmission stage the source and the helper cooperate to transmit the signal to the legitimate receiver. Under this framework, we determine the optimal weights associated with this scheme and examine the secrecy capacity of the helper-assisted wiretap channel. The optimal weight design problem is generally nonconvex. To deal with this issue, an algorithm involving a one-dimensional search is developed. On the other hand, an analytical lower bound on the secrecy capacity is derived.

This leaves room for improving its own RIP, which could work as the foundation of compressed subspace projection matrix recovery. In this work, we study the RIP of subspace projection matrix under random orthonormal compression. Considering the fact that subspace projection matrices of s dimensional subspaces in RN form an s(N - s) dimensional submanifold in RN×N, our main concern is transformed to the stable embedding of such submanifold into RN×N.

This letter analyzes the diversity order attainable by NCC with channel coding (Coded-NCC) in a network topology with multiple sources, one relay and in the presence of fast Rayleigh fading. Due to the difficulty of characterizing the exchange of information between the network decoder and the channel decoder, iterative network and channel decoding algorithms are usually studied with the aid of simulations. In this letter, we overcome this limitation by proposing a near-optimal receiver that performs network decoding and channel decoding in a single decoding step of an equivalent super code. An upper bound and a tight approximation of the Bit Error Rate (BER) for all sources are derived. Based on the upper bound, we analytically show that Coded-NCC achieves a diversity order equal to 2f, where f is the minimum distance of the FEC code. This result generalizes those available for cooperative networks in the absence of channel coding (Uncoded-NCC), where the diversity order is equal to 2, as well as those available for coded transmission but without cooperation, where the diversity order is equal to f.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2405083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7046340","Convolutional codes;cooperative diversity;diversity order;network coding","Relays;Fading;Iterative decoding;Decoding;Bit error rate;Silicon;Channel coding","","11","","20","IEEE","20 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By exploiting the broadcast nature of wireless communications, this novel algorithm has similar performance to broadcast gossip algorithms. Although broadcast gossip algorithms have the fastest rate of convergence among all gossip algorithms, they either converge to a random value rather than the average consensus, or need out-degree information available for each node to guarantee convergence to the average consensus.

However, being reliant on the local differences between neighboring pixels, they are inevitably sensitive to noise. To overcome the problem of noise-vulnerability of the conventional local structure patterns, we propose semi-local structure patterns (SLSP), a novel feature extraction method based on local region-based differences. The SLSP is robust to illumination variations, distortion, and sparse noise because it encodes the relative sizes of the central region with locally neighboring regions into a binary code. The principle of SLSP leads noise-robust expansions of LBP and MCT feature extraction frameworks. In a statistical analysis, we find that the proposed methods transform a substantial amount of random noise patterns in face images into more meaningful uniform patterns. The empirical results on the MIT + CMU dataset and FDDB (face detection dataset and benchmark) show that the proposed semi-local patterns applied to LBP and MCT feature extraction frameworks outperform the conventional LBP and MCT features in AdaBoost-based face detectors, with much higher detection rates.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2372762","National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2010-0025642,NRF-2014R1A1A1002662); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6963353","AdaBoost;distortion;face detection;local binary patterns;semi-local structure patterns","Noise;Face detection;Lighting;Face;Transforms;Feature extraction;Robustness","","29","","10","IEEE","20 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The letter proposes a structure-induced complex Kalman filter framework with reduced communication overhead. In order to further reduce the local computations, the letter proposes a non-circularity criterion which allows each node to examine the non-circularity of its local observations. A local sensor node disregards its extra second-order statistical information when the non-circularity coefficient is small. In cases where the local observations are highly non-circular, an intuitively pleasing circularization approach is proposed to avoid computation and communication of the pseudo-covariance matrices.

Through some assumptions, the conventional SS method regards the attenuation weight as a constant that is a function of reverberation time. However, these assumptions are not valid in real situations, and the ideal weight varies with the frame. Therefore, in the proposed method, the variable weight sequence is estimated using Viterbi decoding scheme based on the reverberation model.

Our framework is totally unsupervised requiring no human-labeled training data. With more expressive features and more complicated model, our framework can accurately detect and localize anomalies in surveillance video. We carried out extensive experiments on several benchmark video datasets for anomaly detection, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our framework to state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness of our framework.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2410031","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:NSFCGrant 61071156,NSFCGrant 61131003); National Key Basic Research Project of China 973Program(grant numbers:2011CB302400); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7054448","AUTHOR: PLEASE ADD INDEX TERMS","Feature extraction;Dictionaries;Vectors;Surveillance;Sparse matrices;Histograms;Context modeling","","82","","33","IEEE","4 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this problem, we propose a novel joint learning-to-rank approach called Deep Latent Structural SVM (DL-SSVM), which jointly learns deep neural networks and latent structural SVM (connected by a set of latent feature grouping variables) to effectively model the interaction relationships at two levels (i.e., feature-level and ranking-level). To make the joint learning problem easier to optimize, we present an effective auxiliary variable-based alternating optimization approach with respect to deep neural network learning and structural latent SVM learning. Experimental results on several challenging datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed learning to rank approach in real-world information retrieval.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2410134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7054452","Deep neural network;joint learning;latent variable;learning to rank;structural SVM","Neural networks;Support vector machines;Vectors;Feature extraction;Joints;Data models;Adaptation models","","9","","24","IEEE","4 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Assuming imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the base station, we develop two robust joint beamforming and power splitting (BFPS) designs that minimize the transmission power under both the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and energy harvesting (EH) constraints per user. In the first design, we consider the worst-case (WC) SINR and EH constraints, and show that the WC-BFPS problem can be relaxed as a semidefinite program (SDP) through a linear matrix inequality representation for (infinitely many) robust quadratic matrix inequality constraints. In the second design, we consider the chance constraints (CCs) for SINR and EH, and resort to both semidefinite relaxation and Bernstein-type inequality restriction to transform the CC-BFPS problem into another convex SDP. Based on these convex reformulations, the (near-)optimal robust BFPS designs can be efficiently solved. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the merit of the proposed robust designs.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2410833","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7056414","Bernstein-type inequality;energy harvesting;power splitting;robust beamforming;semidefinite program","Signal to noise ratio;Interference;Robustness;Array signal processing;Downlink;IP networks;Linear matrix inequalities","","57","","18","IEEE","9 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Cramér–Rao Bound for Sparse Signals Fitting the Low-Rank Model with Small Number of Parameters","M. Shaghaghi; S. A. Vorobyov","Dept.

Although such signals do not necessarily have a sparse representation in a finite basis, they possess a sparse structure which makes it possible to recover the signal from compressed measurements. We study the statistical performance bound for parameter estimation in the low-rank signal model from compressed measurements. Specifically, we derive the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for a generic low-rank model and we show that the number of compressed samples needs to be larger than the number of sources for the existence of an unbiased estimator with finite estimation variance. We further consider the applications to direction-of-arrival (DOA) and spectral estimation which fit into the low-rank signal model. We also investigate the effect of compression on the CRB by considering numerical examples of the DOA estimation scenario, and show how the CRB increases by increasing the compression or equivalently reducing the number of compressed samples.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2409896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7054444","Compressed sensing;Cramér–Rao bound;DOA estimation;low-rank model;spectral estimation","Estimation;Covariance matrices;Vectors;Direction-of-arrival estimation;Numerical models;Noise;Educational institutions","","17","","33","IEEE","4 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
