The Wasserstein barycenter, on one hand, has mostly made its appearance in image processing as it can describe a measure of similarity between images. Its minimization might, for example, suggest the best match in image alignment. On the other hand, MMOSPA estimation has been applied largely to multi-target tracking. The Optimal Sub-Pattern Assignment (OSPA) measures the distance between two sets and the Mean OSPA (MOSPA) can be minimized to give the Minimum MOPSA (MMOSPA), which improves MMSE estimation of the target locations when the labeling of the targets in the set is not important. Approximate and exact algorithms have evolved for both Wasserstein barycenters and MMOSPA estimation. Here, we draw connections between the two perspectives and elaborate how they can benefit from each other.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2410217","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N000014-13-1-0231); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7054438","Barycenter;earth mover's distance;image fusion;multi-target tracking;OSPA distance;Wasserstein distance","Estimation;Image processing;Radar tracking;Signal processing algorithms;Density measurement;Approximation algorithms","","26","","39","IEEE","4 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

According to this hypothesis, a novel IQA metric based on a commonly used object-detecting feature, Speed Up Robust Features (SURF), was proposed. First, it determined the interest points which represented significant objects through the SURF features both on the reference image and distorted image. Then it computed the multilevel SURF descriptors differences between the reference image and the distorted one. Finally, all the difference results were combined with a suitable pooling strategy.

Time-frequency segmentation of the acoustic scene is obtained by employing a sinusoidal detection algorithm, which does not require any estimate of noise and is able to handle multiple simultaneous bird vocalizations. Each segment is characterized as a sequence of frequencies over time, referred to as a frequency track. Each bird species is represented by a hidden Markov model that models the temporal evolution of frequency tracks. The decision on the number and identity of bird species in a given recording is obtained based on maximizing the overall likelihood of the set of detected segments, with a penalization applied for increasing the number of bird models used. Experimental evaluations are performed on audio field recordings containing 30 bird species. The presence of multiple bird species is simulated by joining the set of detected segments from several bird species. Results show that the proposed method can achieve recognition performance for multiple bird species not far from that obtained for single bird species, and considerably outperforms majority voting methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2409173","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7055361","BIC;bird species recognition;frequency track;hidden Markov models;maximum likelihood;multiple bird species;partition;penalization;sinusoid detection","Birds;Hidden Markov models;Acoustics;Time-frequency analysis;Maximum likelihood detection;Noise","","16","","19","IEEE","5 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed algorithm deals well with sudden (and strong) changes, due to the fast convergence of the secondary path model. It is compared with other similar algorithms in the literature. The ability to deal with different physical conditions without changing the algorithms parameters is also compared.

The BWK exploits the corresponding paths between each word in the query and database image to achieve better retrieval performance. The proposed method develops a connected component analysis to detect multiple occurrences of an object with different scales in an image. The method can reduce the computational complexity of geometric verification while achieving accurate object localization. The proposed method is evaluated on the BelgaLogos dataset .

Thus, one can start with a single (mother) beamforming vector, which gives a desired beampattern, but may not satisfy some other desired properties, and generate all other beamforming vectors, which give the same beampattern, in a computationally efficient way. Then the beamforming vectors, which in addition satisfy other desired properties that the mother beamforming vector may not satisfy, can be selected.

By assuming local linearity, we first employ a robust algorithm to model the local manifold of the corrupted data by local line segments. Our rationale is that long line segments should not be expected in a noisy set of points. This assumption leads to the modeling of the lengths of the line segments by a Pareto distribution, which is the adopted a contrario model for the observations.

To solve this problem, the proposed method includes an embedded source separation based on non-negative matrix factorization, which first determines the initial estimate of source location, and then computes the basis matrix of the source using the initial location estimate. In this way, the proposed method can perform the source separation without a training stage. The comparative evaluation confirms that the proposed method provides higher performance in location estimation than the conventional method with a training stage.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2424991","Ministry of Science ICT and Future Planning Korea under Information Technology Research Center(grant numbers:NIPA-2014-H0301-14-1021); Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion Korea(grant numbers:No.10047031); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7090942","Amplitude panning;non-negative matrix factorization;panning gain;sound source location;source separation","Estimation;Source separation;Training;Interference;Principal component analysis;Position measurement;Indexes","","4","","15","IEEE","21 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The novelty lies in that major lines are recruited from the maximally generated yet well-thinned zero threshold Canny edge links based on the, so called, Sobel highlights as the guide for recruitment. The Sobel highlights introduced here represent the scores accumulated at individual pixels that measure their significance of forming line segments along Sobel edge orientations. The proposed method offers several advantages over conventional ones: it is 1) more powerful to extract cursive lines, in particular, with a larger curvature, 2) more effective to represent a line as a whole with less intermittent discontinuities, and 3) more straightforward to use as it relies on no sensitive edge thresholding. Experimentations verify that the proposed method outperforms LSD, a top performance major line detector currently available, by about 20% in the coverage of ground truth major lines as well as in the coverage per major line: an intermittent discontinuity indicator.

While the designed filters get rid of the noise, the high frequency information will also be degraded, as the filters fit into a nature of integration. To preserve the high frequency information and hence the denoising performance, we propose a preprocessing filter designed in the wavelet domain, can be placed prior to the given existing spatial domain averaging filter. The proposed filter enhances high frequency information of given noisy image and obviously this enhanced information will also be degraded at some extent by the subsequent spatial domain filters. Accordingly, proposed preprocessing filter and existing average based spatial domain filter on a whole gives improved denoising performance. Simulation experiments have been conducted and it is proved that the proposed preprocessing filter certainly improves the denoising results of existing standard spatial domain filtering such as Anisotropic filtering, Bilateral filtering, Non local means filtering and recently proposed Probabilistic non local means filtering in terms of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM).","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2426432","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7094256","Anisotropic filter;bilateral filter;Gaussian noise;non local means filter;preprocessing filter;probabilistic non local means filter;spatial averaging;wavelet domain","Noise reduction;Information filters;Noise measurement;IEEE Xplore;Noise","","5","","17","IEEE","24 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While considerable effort has been made, automatic music annotation is still considered challenging due to the difficulty of extracting good audio features that capture the characteristics of different tags. To address this issue, we present in this letter two exemplar-based approaches that represent the content of a music clip by referring to a large set of unlabeled audio exemplars. The first approach represents a music clip by the set of audio exemplars that is highly correlated with the short-time feature vectors of the clip, whereas the second approach represents a music clip as sparse linear combinations of its short-time feature vectors over the audio exemplars. Music annotation is then performed by learning the relevance of the audio examples to different tags using labeled data. These two approaches effectively capitalize the availability of unlabeled data to explore the commonality of music signals to find out tag-specific acoustic patterns, without domain knowledge and feature design. Evaluation on the CAL10k music genre tagging dataset for tag-based music retrieval shows that, with thousands of unlabeled audio examples randomly drawn from the Million Song Dataset, the proposed approaches lead to remarkably higher precision rates than existing approaches.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2433061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7106493","Music tagging;retrieval;sparse representation","Training;Dictionaries;Feature extraction;Multiple signal classification;Correlation;Signal processing algorithms;Tagging","","18","","50","IEEE","13 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method is based on a natural generalization of the graphical LASSO algorithm, introduced originally for the case of i.i.d. samples, and estimates the conditional independence graph of a time series from a finite length observation. The graphical LASSO for time series is defined as the solution of an l1-regularized maximum (approximate) likelihood problem. We solve this optimization problem using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Our approach is nonparametric as we do not assume a finite dimensional parametric model, but only require the process to be sufficiently smooth in the spectral domain. For Gaussian processes, we characterize the performance of our method theoretically by deriving an upper bound on the probability that our algorithm fails. Numerical experiments demonstrate the ability of our method to recover the correct conditional independence graph from a limited amount of samples.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2425434","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7091904","ADMM;graphical LASSO;graphical model selection;nonparametric time series;sparsity","Time series analysis;Signal processing algorithms;Graphical models;Upper bound;Algorithm design and analysis;Estimation error;Linear programming","","47","","26","IEEE","22 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The l1 norm has been extensively used as a regularizer to promote sparsity; however, it tends to under-estimate non-zero values of the underlying signal. To more accurately estimate non-zero values, we propose the use of a non-convex regularizer, chosen so as to ensure convexity of the objective function. The convexity of the objective function is ensured by constraining the parameter of the non-convex penalty. We use ADMM to obtain a solution and show how to guarantee that ADMM converges to the global optimum of the objective function. We illustrate the proposed method for 1D and 2D signal denoising.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2432095","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7105866","Analysis model;convex optimization;non-convex regularization;sparse signal;tight frame","Linear programming;Noise reduction;Signal denoising;Transforms;Computer vision;Image reconstruction;Convergence","","58","","38","IEEE","12 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Second, the atmospheric light and transmission are estimated according to the new model combined with dark channel prior. Lastly, the haze is successfully removed from remote sensing images using the proposed estimation algorithm. The estimated transmission is insensitive to the texture of ground objects, and the dehazing effect for nonuniform haze is more satisfactory than the compared method. Moreover, our approach can be used for general haze removal through adjusting the translation term.

The features, which are sensitive to each distortion type even in the presence of other distortions, are first selected from three kinds of NSS features. An improved Bag-of-Words (BoW) model is then applied to encode the selected features. Lastly, a simple yet effective linear combination is used to map the image features to the quality score. The combination weights are obtained through lasso regression. A series of experiments show that the feature selection strategy and the improved BoW model are effective in improving the accuracy of quality prediction for multiple distortion IQA.

However, when SDM learns the generic descent maps, it is very difficult to avoid over-fitting due to the high dimensionality of the input features. In this paper we propose a Random Subspace SDM (RSSDM) that maintains the high accuracy on the training data and improves the generalization accuracy. Instead of using all the features for descent learning at each iteration, we randomly select sub-sets of the features and learn an ensemble of descent maps in the corresponding subspaces, one in each subspace. Then, we average the ensemble of descents to calculate the update of the iteration. We test the proposed methods on two representative regression problems, namely, 3D pose estimation and face alignment and show that RSSDM consistently outperforms SDM in both tasks in terms of accuracy (e.g., RSSDM is able to localize 4% more landmarks at error level of 0.1 on the challenging iBug dataset). RSSDM also holds several useful generalization properties: 1) it is more effective when the number of training samples is small-with 3 Monte-Carlo permutations RSSDM can achieve similar performance to SDM with 9 Monte-Carlo permutations; 2) it is less sensitive to the changes of the strength of the regularization-when the regularization parameter is changed to 10 times larger, the mean error increases 9.0% for SDM vs. 3.4% for RSSDM.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2437883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7113795","3D pose estimation;face alignment;random subspace;supervised descent method","Face;Three-dimensional displays;Shape;Training;Estimation;Feature extraction;Computer vision","","12","","13","IEEE","1 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
