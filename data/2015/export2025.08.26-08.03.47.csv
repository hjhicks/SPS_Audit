It is designed based on the maximum-likelihood criterion but takes more candidates for the antenna activation orders into account. The detection is performed in two steps: the first step is to confine the number of candidates for the modulated symbols to a small portion by exploiting the symmetry of the signal constellation; the second step is to select the most likely modulated symbols from the output of the first step according to the determined antenna activation order via a Viterbi-like algorithm.

To deal with the challenge of detecting median filtering from small-size and compressed image blocks, by taking into account of the properties of median filtering, we propose a median filtering detection method based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can automatically learn and obtain features directly from the image. To our best knowledge, this is the first work of applying CNNs in median filtering image forensics. Unlike conventional CNN models, the first layer of our CNN framework is a filter layer that accepts an image as the input and outputs its median filtering residual (MFR). Then, via alternating convolutional layers and pooling layers to learn hierarchical representations, we obtain multiple features for further classification. We test the proposed method on several experiments.

In this paper, we propose a feature based on the long term variation of the logarithm of the short-time sub-band signal energy for WAD. We also propose an automatic sub-band selection algorithm to maximally discriminate noisy whisper from noise.

Based on additional assumptions on the statistics of the random variables in observation and process equation, we apply the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to derive an NLMS-like filter adaptation. By exploiting the conditional independence rules for Bayesian networks, we reveal that the resulting EM-NLMS algorithm has a stepsize update equivalent to the optimal-stepsize calculation proposed by Yamamoto and Kitayama in 1982, which has been adopted in many textbooks. As main difference, the instantaneous stepsize value is estimated in the M step of the EM algorithm (instead of being approximated by artificially extending the acoustic echo path).

The difference in mean squared error between a minimum mean squared error estimate using unquantized data and a minimum mean squared error estimate using both quantized and unquantized data is used to quantify the value of fusing the two kinds of data. Discussion of the Cramér-Rao Bound predicts how noise in the quantized data affects the reduction in estimate mean squared error from fusing the data types. It is then determined that the maximum reduction in estimate mean squared error from fusion can be approximated as a rational function of the ratio of the standard deviations of the measurement noise in the two data types. Finally, similarities between the approximation to the reduction in estimate mean squared error for the most favorable uniform prior width and a closed form expression based on the Cramér-Rao Bound are discussed.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2446975","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7128352","Cramér-Rao bound;parameter estimation;quantization;wireless sensor networks","Noise;Noise measurement;Approximation methods;Temperature measurement;Estimation;Standards;Wireless sensor networks","","9","","11","IEEE","18 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although these gains have been achieved in periodic National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) evaluations, the problem of domain mismatch, where the system development data and the application data are collected from different sources, remains a challenging one. The impact of domain mismatch was a focus of the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) 2013 speaker recognition workshop, where a domain adaptation challenge (DAC13) corpus was created to address this problem. This paper proposes an approach to domain mismatch compensation for applications where in-domain development data is assumed to be unavailable. The method is based on a generalization of data whitening used in association with i-vector length normalization and utilizes a library of whitening transforms trained at system development time using strictly out-of-domain data.

The salient idea of this letter is to compute the optimal set of functions to model the region intensities. Our solution to this problem involves the integration of a level set segmentation methodology with the dictionary learning framework. This provides an elegant solution to deal with intensity inhomogeneities prevalent in many imaging applications such as ultrasound and fluorescence microscopy. The proposed algorithm, Dictionary Learning Level Set (DL2S) is used to segment ultrasound images of blood vessels captured using low cost, portable ultrasound devices employed in a phlebotomy application.

A single-atom sparse representation vector of this residual is calculated and the chosen dictionary is updated. For a given training signal, the process of model (dictionary) selection and one-atom representation is repeated until the desired sparsity or approximation error is reached. Thus, the proposed strategy provides a mechanism whereby each signal can update the most relevant dictionaries based on the structure of its residuals.

Real-world texture images often present challenges for classification algorithms in terms of intra-class variability due, among others, to variable illumination. The LBP operator, a state-of-the-art texture descriptor, possesses key properties for tackling real-world texture images: discriminative power and invariance against monotonic gray level changes. We propose a novel texture classification approach that increases the robustness of LBP-based methods with respect to any type of intra-class variations. The method locally characterizes each pixel with an LBP code histogram and globally computes the label of a textured image by aggregating pixel labels through a voting process. Our approach can be in principle applied to any LBP version, as it focuses on how statistics are computed from LBP codes. We show that the proposed pixel-based approach improves upon traditional LBP block-based approaches in terms of classification accuracy by up to 5.1 p.p. on the public Outex database for the classic LBP with various neighborhoods as well as for various LBP extensions.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2461026","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Collaborative Research and Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7167687","Image classification;image texture;local binary pattern;pixel-based classification","Histograms;Robustness;Joints;Image classification;Face recognition;Protocols","","11","","20","IEEE","27 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This letter proposes a novel way to design quaternion-valued kernels, this is achieved by transforming three complex kernels into quaternion ones and then combining their real and imaginary parts.

For a given array constellation, it is possible to select beamforming weights which maximize the DF for a particular look-direction, while enforcing nulls for a set of undesired directions. In general, the resulting DF is dependent upon the specific look- and null directions. Using the same array, one may apply a different set of weights designed for any other feasible set of look- and null directions. In this contribution, we show that when the optimal DF is averaged over all look directions, the result equals the number of sensors minus the number of null constraints. This result holds regardless of the positions and spatial responses of the individual sensors and regardless of the null directions. The result generalizes to more complex wave-propagation domains (e.g., reverberation).","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2461597","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7172463","Array signal processing;directivity factor;directivity index","Arrays;Noise;Sensors;Array signal processing;Optimized production technology;Propagation;Reverberation","","5","","9","IEEE","29 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A simplified representation of the time-frequency structure of a signal can therefore be given by the Delaunay triangulation attached to spectrogram zeros. In the case of multicomponent nonstationary signals embedded in white Gaussian noise, it turns out that each time-frequency domain attached to a given component can be viewed as the union of adjacent Delaunay triangles whose edge length is an outlier as compared to the distribution in noise-only regions. Identifying such domains offers a new way of disentangling the different components in the time-frequency plane, as well as of reconstructing the corresponding waveforms.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2463093","Agence Nationale de la Recherche; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7180335","Delaunay triangulation;filtering;spectrogram;time–frequency analysis","Spectrogram;Time-frequency analysis;Gaussian noise;Transforms;Kernel","","63","","23","IEEE","5 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Instead of comparing only the spectral content of two frames, the proposed method takes into account a wider temporal context to evaluate the dissimilarity between a given frame and its previous frames. More specifically, the dissimilarity is measured by using the previous frames to obtain a linear reconstruction of the given frame, and then calculating the rectified, l2-norm reconstruction error. Evaluation on a dataset comprising 2,169 onset events of 12 instruments shows that this simple idea works fairly well. When a non-negativity constraint is imposed in the linear reconstruction, the proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art unsupervised method SuperFlux by 2.9% in F-score. Moreover, the proposed method is particularly effective for instruments with soft onsets, such as violin, cello, and ney. The proposed method is efficient, easy to implement, and is applicable to scenarios of online onset detection.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2466447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7185355","Exemplar;linear reconstruction;musical onset","Signal processing algorithms;Instruments;Multiple signal classification;Context;Measurement uncertainty;Indexes;Music information retrieval","","5","","44","IEEE","11 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Assuming the channel state information (CSI) of the EH receivers is not perfectly known at the transmitter, we aim to maximize the worst-case secrecy rate by jointly designing the precoding matrix, AN covariance matrix and power splsplitting ratio, under the constraints of total transmit power and harvested energyitting ratio, under the constraints of total transmit power and harvested energy at receivers. The formulated problem is non-convex and semi-infinite, which is hard to tackle. To solve it, we first deal with the non-convexity caused by CSI errors with the aid of the S-Procedure, and then employ the Taylor series approximation techniques to transfer the nonconvex problem into a convex optimization problem. Based on that, we propose an iterative algorithm with proved convergence to solve the original problem. Simulation results are finconvex optimization problem.

This method is only capable of unambiguously measuring range within an interval of length equal to the wavelength of the signal. To address this problem signals of multiple different wavelengths can be transmitted. The range can then be measured within an interval of length equal to the least common multiple of these wavelengths. Estimation of the range requires solution of a problem from computational number theory called the closest lattice point problem. Algorithms to solve this problem require a basis for this lattice. Constructing a basis is non-trivial and an explicit construction has only been given in the case that the wavelengths can be scaled to pairwise relatively prime integers. In this paper we present an explicit construction of a basis without this assumption on the wavelengths. This is important because the accuracy of the range estimator depends upon the wavelengths. Simulations indicate that significant improvement in accuracy can be achieved by using wavelengths that cannot be scaled to pairwise relatively prime integers.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2465153","Australian Research Council(grant numbers:LP130100514); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7180337","Closest lattice point;phase unwrapping;range estimation","Lattices;Least squares approximations;Estimation;Signal processing algorithms;Receivers;Zinc;Wavelength measurement","","20","","44","IEEE","5 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show that if the observations relate to the parameters via Gaussian likelihoods, the F-B priors form a conjugate model that yields closed-form, recursive estimators that naturally take into account the restrictions on the unknowns. We apply this model to a communication setup with multiple gain-controlled FIR frequency-selective channels, deriving a novel maximum a posteriori (MAP) channel parameter estimator and a blind equalizer based on Rao–Blackwellized particle filters.
