In this paper, we demonstrate that it is also feasible to hide the compression evidence of lossy predictive image coding, a class of compression paradigm widely employed in critical scenarios. To tackle the challenging issue of error propagation inherent to predictive coding, we design a prediction-direction preserving strategy, allowing us to add dither noise in the prediction error (PE) domain, while minimizing the incurred distortion.

The proposed generalized Wald test (GWT) is a Separating Function Estimation Test (SFET) which is a type of detector recently introduced for a wide class of composite problems. The test statistics of an SFET is an estimate of a real-valued Separating Function (SF). It is already proved that a Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator of any SF leads to the optimal Uniformly Most Powerful unbiased detector. In many practical cases, such an optimal detector does not exist; hence, suboptimal ones are used, instead. Selecting an SF with a guaranteed performance is still an open problem which is investigated in this letter. First, we derive a lower bound for the detection probability of the SFET in terms of corresponding SF and the Fisher Information Matrix. Then we optimize the proposed bound with respect to the SF. The solution of the optimization problem leads to a generalization of the Wald test which is asymptotically optimal and reduces to the Wald detector in some special cases. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed GWT over its counterparts, namely, the Wald test and GLR detector in some examples.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2472991","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7222406","CFAR;GLR;Rao;separating function (SF);separating function estimation test (SFET);Wald","Detectors;Testing;Maximum likelihood estimation;Optimization;Simulation;Signal processing","","22","","31","IEEE","25 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We capture the mobility in the leader-follower algorithm by abstracting it as a Linear Time-Varying (LTV) system with random system matrices. In particular, a mobile node, moving randomly in a bounded region, updates its state when it finds neighbors; and does not update when it is not in the communication range of any other node. In this context, we develop certain regularity conditions on the system and input matrices such that each follower converges to the leader state. To analyze the corresponding LTV system, we partition the entire chain of system matrices into non-overlapping slices, and relate the convergence of the sensor network to the lengths of these slices. In contrast to the existing results, we show that a bounded length on the slices, capturing the dissemination of information from the leader to the followers, is not required; as long as the slice-lengths are finite and do not grow faster than a certain exponential rate.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2474134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7226821","Data fusion;distributed algorithms;LTV systems;sensor networks","Convergence;Heuristic algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Mobile computing;Time-varying systems;Mobile nodes","","14","","33","IEEE","27 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For low light-level depth imaging applications, such as remote sensing and robot vision, these systems use single-photon detectors that resolve individual photon arrivals. Even so, they must detect a large number of photons to mitigate Poisson shot noise and reject anomalous photon detections from background light. We introduce a novel framework for accurate depth imaging using a small number of detected photons in the presence of an unknown amount of background light that may vary spatially. It employs a Poisson observation model for the photon detections plus a union-of-subspaces constraint on the discrete-time flux from the scene at any single pixel. Together, they enable a greedy signal-pursuit algorithm to rapidly and simultaneously converge on accurate estimates of scene depth and background flux, without any assumptions on spatial correlations of the depth or background flux. Using experimental single-photon data, we demonstrate that our proposed framework recovers depth features with 1.7 cm absolute error, using 15 photons per image pixel and an illumination pulse with 6.7-cm scaled root-mean-square length. We also show that our framework outperforms the conventional pixelwise log-matched filtering, which is a computationally-efficient approximation to the maximum-likelihood solution, by a factor of 6.1 in absolute depth error.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2475274","Division of Computing and Communication Foundations(grant numbers:1422034); Lincoln Laboratory; Samsung Scholarship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7234865","Computational imaging;greedy algorithms;LIDAR;single-photon imaging;union-of-subspaces","Photonics;Imaging;Detectors;Noise;Correlation;Lighting;Calibration","","20","","15","IEEE","1 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As this problem is non-convex and difficult to be solved, we propose an iterative dynamic power splitting algorithm based on analyzing the first order necessary condition of the optimal solution.

Since many applications require flexible estimation of the shape parameter, we propose a new FP algorithm, Riemannian averaged FP (RA-FP), which can effectively estimate the scatter matrix for any value of the shape parameter. We provide the mathematical justification of the convergence of the RA-FP algorithm based on the Riemannian geometry of the space of symmetric positive definite matrices.

To overcome this drawback, we introduce the refined composite MPE (RCMPE). Through applications on both synthetic and real data, we show that RCMPE is much less dependent on the signal length than MPE. In this sense, RCMPE is more reliable than MPE. RCMPE could therefore replace MPE for short times series or at large scale factors.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2482603","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7279095","Complexity;entropy;fractal;multiscale entropy;nonlinear dynamics;permutation entropy","Entropy;Time series analysis;White noise;Delays;Signal processing algorithms;Complexity theory;Reliability","","86","","15","IEEE","28 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Finally, stationary objects are detected as those stability changes that exceed an alarm time and have not been visualized before.

Here we propose a novel local patch-based objective quality assessment method using an adaptive representation of local patch structure, which allows us to decompose any image patch into its mean intensity, signal strength and signal structure components and then evaluate their perceptual distortions in different ways. A unique feature that differentiates the proposed method from previous contrast quality models is the capability to produce a local contrast quality map, which predicts local quality variations over space and may be employed to guide contrast enhancement algorithms.

But almost all inductive LP models use 1D vectors of images as inputs, which may destroy the topology structure of image pixels and usually suffer from high complexity due to the high dimension of 1D vectors in reality. To preserve the topology among pixels and address the scalability issue for the embedding based scheme, we propose a simple yet efficient Bilinear Embedding Label Propagation (BELP) by including a bilinear regularization term in terms of tensor representation to correlate the image labels with their bilinear features. BELP performs label prediction over the 2D matrices rather than 1D vectors, since images are essentially matrices. Finally, labels of new images can be easily obtained by embedding them onto a spanned bilinear subspace solved from a joint framework.

DDRC consists of two parts: pixel difference binary pattern (PDBP) and difference regression classification (DRC). PDBP calculates the pixel differences in image domain, and then the pixel differences are binarized and converted to decimal values. DRC calculates the vector differences in feature domain to estimate an optimal predictor matrix. Experimental results on noiseless and noisy images of Yale B, Extended Yale B, JAFFE, AT&T, and GT databases with different image sizes show the effectiveness of the proposed face recognition method in terms of the recognition accuracy.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2492980","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7302033","DDRC;difference regression classification;face recognition;LBP;LRC;pixel difference binary pattern","Face recognition;Accuracy;Image recognition;Linear regression","","5","","18","IEEE","26 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Little efforts have been done in spite of the importance and functionality of this subject. Most of existing methods have been trying to exploit and represent techniques based on metric learning to increase verification rate, paying no attention to the effect of the features extracted from the faces. Despite the previous methods exploiting simple local features, we have focused on the combination and selection of effective features in this paper. To this end, local and global features were combined to describe the face images in a better way. The effective and discriminative features were selected using the kinship genetic algorithm and then fulfilled kinship verification. The proposed method is tested and analysed on the standard and big datasets KinFaceW-I and KinFaceW-II, and verification rates of 81.3% and 86.15% were obtained respectively.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2490805","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7298406","Biometric;feature selection;genetic algorithm;global and local features;kinship verification","Feature extraction;Algorithm design and analysis;Genetic algorithms;Face recognition;Biometrics (access control)","","54","","23","IEEE","14 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, we devise an iteratively reweighted HOSVD technique, which is referred to as IR-HOSVD, for multi-dimensional frequency estimation in the presence of impulsive noise. The main idea is to minimize the ${\ell _p}$-norm residual errors along all the $R$ dimensions, where $1 < p < 2$. After decomposition, standard subspace techniques can be applied for parameter estimation. Based on the numerical results, IR-HOSVD outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques in terms of root mean square frequency error for different impulsive noise models.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2493521","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7303900","Harmonic retrieval;higher-order singular value decomposition;${\ell _p}$-norm;parameter estimation;tensor","Parameter estimation;Robustness;Singular value decomposition;Minimization;Noise","","16","","34","IEEE","26 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The hyperparameters are controlled by each feature's computational cost.

A rapid remote evaluation on physiological signal frequencies is needed in search and rescue operations as well as intensive care. However, the presence of respiration harmonics causes aliasing problems to heart-rate estimation, especially when the data volume is limited. By taking advantage of the simple pattern of physiological signals, we propose a stepwise atomic norm minimization method (StANM) to accurately assess the respiration and heartbeat frequencies with a limited data volume. First, the respiration frequency is estimated by the conventional atomic norm minimization. Then the frequencies of respiration harmonics are generated based on the inherent relationship between the fundamental tone and the harmonics. Finally, with the pre-estimated frequencies, we locate the heartbeat frequency by solving a modified atomic norm minimization problem. Simulations and experiments show that the proposed method can accurately estimate physiological frequencies from 6.5-second-long raw data with a 4-Hz sampling rate.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2494604","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:No. 2013T6054); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:SBK2014043201); Clinical Special Science Foundation of Science and Technology Department of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BL2012062); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61301022); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7307118","Atomic norm minimization;line spectral estimation;noncontact;super-resolution;vital sign detection","Heart beat;Frequency estimation;Harmonic analysis;Signal processing algorithms;Multiple signal classification;Minimization;Biomedical monitoring","","24","","12","IEEE","26 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We then propose the use of quasi-factorial prior and show how it impacts the total variability space and its application for i-vector extraction. The quasi-factorial prior could be used in a standalone manner, or in combination with a subspace prior. In the latter context, we found that the performance of the standard i-vector can be greatly improved with the use of quasi-factorial prior followed by a subspace prior.

Taking a complex exponential in noise as the input and deriving the analytical expression of its odd-DFT coefficient, we obtain an interpolated odd-DFT-based frequency estimator. Experiments show that the proposed estimator outperforms all other reported odd-DFT/MDCT domain estimators and has precision that is similar to that of representative DFT domain frequency estimators. The overhead for incorporating this estimator into a speech and audio processing system is small due to the simple odd-DFT to MDCT conversion. The corresponding magnitude and phase estimators are also proposed in this letter.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2496276","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:NSFC61173110); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7312935","Audio processing;frequency estimation;MDCT;odd-DFT","Frequency estimation;Discrete Fourier transforms;Frequency-domain analysis;Signal processing algorithms","","10","","21","IEEE","30 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
