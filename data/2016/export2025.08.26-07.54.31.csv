We show that the reconstruction error of CoBP decays like ${M^{ - 1/4}}$ when all parameters but $M$  are fixed.

In this context, we propose a robust background subtraction technique with three contributions. First, we present the use of color difference histogram (CDH) in the background subtraction algorithm. This is done by measuring the color difference between a pixel and its neighbors in a small local neighborhood. The use of CDH reduces the number of false errors due to the non-stationary background, illumination variation and camouflage. Secondly, the color difference is fuzzified with a Gaussian membership function. Finally, a novel fuzzy color difference histogram (FCDH) is proposed by using fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering and exploiting the CDH. The use of FCM clustering algorithm in CDH reduces the large dimensionality of the histogram bins in the computation and also lessens the effect of intensity variation generated due to the fake motion or change in illumination of the background. The proposed algorithm is tested with various complex scenes of some benchmark publicly available video sequences. It exhibits better performance over the state-of-the-art background subtraction techniques available in the literature in terms of classification accuracy metrics like MCC and PCC.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2498839","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7321774","Background subtraction;camouflage;color difference histogram;fuzzy c-means clustering;illumination variation;moving object detection;non-stationary background","Histograms;Signal processing algorithms;Color;Image color analysis;Lighting;Robustness;Clustering algorithms","","60","1","25","IEEE","6 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Assuming time division multiple access (TDMA), we propose a novel transmission scheme for jointly optimal allocation of the BS broadcasting power and time sharing among the wireless nodes, which maximizes the overall network throughput, under the constraint of average transmit power and maximum transmit power at the BS. The proposed scheme significantly outperforms “state of the art” schemes that employ only the optimal time allocation.

Cascaded linear regression approaches have shown the capability to achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy on numerous face alignment datasets. However, most of these approaches only learn to map coordinate offsets of the key points from image features. This regression strategy can be easily trapped in local optima. We propose a novel regression strategy by introducing affine transformation. First, the best affine-transformation parameters between the initial mean shape and the ground truth are estimated by Procrustes analysis. Subsequently, we base the mapping from image features on the best affine-transformation parameters. Experimental results indicate that this strategy can reduce the offsets between two shapes significantly. Combined with coordinate-offset regression strategy, the hybrid approach produces a remarkably performance in term of accuracy, training time, prediction rate, and the model size. Moreover, the affine-transformation parameter regression strategy can be considered as a shape-initialization method that can be combined with other initial shape-based face alignment algorithms to improve the face alignment accuracy.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2499778","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61125201,61402507,U1435219); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7328260","Affine transformation;face alignment;key points regression (KPR);supervised descent method (SDM)","Face;Shape;Training;Robustness;Feature extraction;Accuracy;Linear regression","","12","","17","IEEE","12 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a new similarity learning method for person re-identification. Conventional metric learning methods generally learn a linear transformation by employing sparse pairwise or triplet constraints. Since a lot of negative matching pairs or triplets are abandoned, the discriminative information is not fully exploited. Similarity learning methods with AUC loss can utilize all valid triplet constraints. However, the AUC loss has its own limitation by treating all false ranks occured at different positions equally.

In this scenario, double-talk refers to the situation in which there is an active speaker both in the remote room and in the local room. The detection of double-talk is one of the main issues to be faced in such systems to ensure a correct echo cancellation. Indeed, filters coefficients update has to be suppressed during double-talk in order to prevent the filter from diverging because of the presence of the local speaker. In this paper, a novel approach for double-talk detection is discussed based on the estimation of the fundamental frequency of the residual error signals through adaptive second-order notch filters. More specifically, simultaneous speaker activity in the remote and local rooms is revealed by exploiting the same frequency tracking introduced for multichannel decorrelation. Several experiments have been carried out to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach also making comparison with other solutions of the state of the art.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2502761","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7332929","Fundamental frequency estimation;multichannel acoustic echo cancellation;multichannel double-talk detection","Frequency estimation;Decorrelation;Microphones;Echo cancellers;Loudspeakers;Indexes","","13","","15","IEEE","20 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this problem, we propose a mixture of experts (MoE) method to jointly learn the feature space partition and local regression models. Our MoE consists of two components: gating network learning and local regressors learning. An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is adopted to train MoE on a large set of LR/HR patch pairs.

Our goal is to identify the secrecy capacity behavior in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes, i.e., the maximal achievable secure degrees of freedom (S.D.o.F). Such S.D.o.F maximization is generally difficult to solve since it requires to face a nonlinear fractional problem. To deal with this issue, we first propose a cooperative secrecy transmission scheme, and prove its optimality in the sense of achieving the maximal S.D.o.F..

In a previous work, we showed that a simple and lightweight method could be effectively applied, based on a free phonetic decoding of the speech signal and the alignment of the free and reference phonetic sequences, allowing the transfer of timestamps from the former to the latter. This method has yielded competitive results on the Hub4-97 dataset and is currently applied to synchronize the videos and minutes of the Basque Parliament plenary sessions. In this paper, probabilistic kernels (similarity functions) are applied, based on the hypothesis that a confusion matrix computed from a large corpus of speech conveys key information about the behavior of the phonetic decoder, and that the probabilistic interpretation of this information may help design informative kernels leading to improved alignments.

It has been shown that discrete-time complex exponentials are asymptotic pseudomodes (i.e., approximate eigenvectors) of sequences of Toeplitz matrices. In this letter we show that complex exponentials over the observation interval are pseudomodes of LTI operators, corresponding to pseudoeigenvalues that are samples from the operator's frequency response, and how the level of approximation depends on the ratio of the impulse response duration to observation interval length.

The factorization can be performed offline through fixed point iterations. The proposed measurement matrix design directly exploits possible transmitter mobility through a parametric framework. The findings are validated through analysis, computer simulation and hardware experiments. Sub-pixel localization accuracy with significant compression is achieved, and the proposed compressive parameter estimation outperforms results obtained using a Gaussian measurement matrix.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2506683","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-1202001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7349175","Compressive sensing;parameter estimation;visible light communication","Cameras;Light emitting diodes;Arrays;Transmitters;Correlation;Hardware;Parameter estimation","","","","21","IEEE","8 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A new interpretation of the horseshoe model is presented, and extensions to logistic regression and alternative hierarchies, such as horseshoe+, are discussed. Due to the conjugacy of the proposed hierarchy, Chib's algorithm may be used to easily compute the marginal likelihood of the model.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2503725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7337406","Bayesian regression;horseshoe estimator;Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling","Bayes methods;Logistics;Mathematical model;Linear regression;Computational modeling;Signal processing algorithms;Data models","","159","","18","IEEE","25 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
