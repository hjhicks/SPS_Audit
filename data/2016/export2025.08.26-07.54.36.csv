In the blind one bit compressed sensing framework, the original signal to be reconstructed from one bit linear random measurements is sparse in an unknown domain. In this context, the multiplication of measurement matrix A and sparse domain matrix Φ, i.e., D = AΦ, should be learned. Hence, we use dictionary learning to train this matrix. Towards that end, an appropriate continuous convex cost function is suggested for one bit compressed sensing and a simple steepest-descent method is exploited to learn the rows of the matrix D. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm against the case of no dictionary learning, specially with increasing the number of training signals and the number of sign measurements.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2503804","Iran National elite; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7337377","Compressed sensing;dictionary learning;one bit measurements;steepest-descent","Signal processing algorithms;Compressed sensing;Sparse matrices;Biomedical measurement;Noise measurement","","33","","23","IEEE","25 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the first step, parameters such as angle of arrival or time of arrival are estimated at each base station independently. In the second step, the estimated parameters are used to determine the location of the transmitters. The direct position determination approach advocates using the observations from all the base stations together in order to estimate the locations in a single step. This single-step method is known to outperform two-step methods when the signal-to-noise ratio is low. In this paper, we propose a direct-position-determination-based method for localization of multiple emitters that transmit unknown signals. The method does not require knowledge of the number of emitters. It is based on minimum-variance-distortionless-response considerations to achieve a high resolution estimator that requires only a two-dimensional search for planar geometry, and a three-dimensional search for the general case.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2503921","Israel Science Foundation(grant numbers:503/15,965/15); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7337378","Array processing;direct position determination;emitter localization;maximum likelihood;minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR);multiple signal classification (MUSIC)","Direct position determination;Maximum likelihood estimation;Transmitters;Signal resolution;Signal to noise ratio;Multiple signal classification ","","122","","10","IEEE","25 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the correlation among color channels may be disturbed and it is unclear how to preserve the channel correlation so as to increase empirical security. In this paper, we propose a strategy called CMD-C (clustering modification directions for color components). The basic idea of the strategy is to change different color components from the same pixel location towards a positive or negative direction consistently. To implement the strategy, we decompose an image into several sub-images in which segmented hidden message bits are successively embedded. The embedding costs of a sub-image are computed by considering the correlation both within and among color channels. Experimental results show that the proposed CMD-C strategy has made great improvement over conventional methods in resisting state-of-the-art steganalytic methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2504583","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61572329,61402295,61332012,U1135001); NSF(grant numbers:2014A030313557); Shenzhen R and D Program(grant numbers:GJHZ20140418191518323); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7342902","Color channel correlation;modification direction;steganalysis;steganography","Image color analysis;Correlation;Color;Security;Customer relationship management;Gray-scale;Feature extraction","","30","","18","IEEE","1 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, we propose an effective anti-forensic approach that performs CE without significant distortion in both the first and second order statistics of the enhanced image.

Traditional edge-stop functions (ESFs) utilize only gradient information, which fails to stop contour evolution at such boundaries because of the small gradient magnitudes. To address this problem, we propose a framework to construct a group of ESFs for edge-based active contour models to segment objects with poorly defined boundaries. In our framework, which incorporates gradient information as well as probability scores from a standard classifier, the ESF can be constructed from any classification algorithm and applied to any edge-based model using a level set method. Experiments on medical images using the distance regularized level set for edge-based active contour models as well as the k-nearest neighbours and the support vector machine confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2508039","A STAR Singapore China Joint Research Program(grant numbers:12105009; WBS: R265-000-467-305); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7353157","Edge-based active contour;edge-stop function;gradient information;image segmentation;probability score","Image edge detection;Image segmentation;Active contours;Level set;Support vector machines;Signal processing algorithms;Biomedical imaging","","86","","30","IEEE","11 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, a novel algorithm is proposed which consists of two main steps of MA Cancellation and Spectral Analysis. The MA cancellation step cleanses the MA-contaminated PPG signals utilizing the acceleration data and the spectral analysis step estimates a higher resolution spectrum of the signal and selects the spectral peaks corresponding to HR. Experimental results on datasets recorded from 12 subjects during fast running at the peak speed of 15 km/hour showed that the proposed algorithm achieves an average absolute error of 1.25 beat per minute (BPM).

We propose a method to assign a reassembled image file with a score indicating its quality, defined as the amount of information that the reassembled image affords for its original image. The score ranges from 0 to 1. A higher score indicates better quality. The basic idea of the proposed method is to disintegrate the quality assessment of a reassembled image file into the calculations of the contributions of the fragments contained in the reassembled image file. For each fragment, if it is not from the original image file, it affords the least contribution. Otherwise its contribution depends on the extent to which the fragment and its neighbor fragments are concatenated correctly. We validate the performance of the proposed method with an extensive subjective study involving 588 reassembled image files. We also show that the existing quality assessments for images cannot be directly used to assess the quality of reassembled image files.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2510446","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:HIT.

In order to make full use of the relationships among speech, noise, and mixture in sparse representation for speech enhancement, this letter proposes a novel sparsity model that consists of a couple of joint sparse representations (JSRs). One JSR uses the mapping relationship between mixture and speech while the other uses that between mixture and noise. Both relationships are used to constrain the joint dictionary learning, which effectively solves the source confusion problem of traditional methods. Moreover, the latter JSR can be complementary to the former JSR, depending on the level of structure of the noise.

Leveraging on recent advances in graph signal processing (GSP), we propose a dequantization scheme specifically for piecewise smooth (PWS) images: images with sharp object boundaries and smooth interior surfaces. We first mathematically define a PWS image as a low-frequency signal with respect to an inter-pixel similarity graph with edges of weights 1 or 0. Using quantization bin boundaries as constraints, we then jointly optimize the desired graph-signal and the similarity graph in a unified framework. A generalization to consider generalized piecewise smooth (GPWS) images—where sharp object boundaries are replaced by transition regions—is also proposed.

Interestingly, a mutual information-based assessment shows superior discrimination power for the source-related features, especially the proposed ones. The features are further the input of an artificial neural network-based classifier trained on a multi-condition database. Two strategies are proposed to merge source and filter information: feature and decision fusion.

It was shown that M-channel oversampled filter bank which is exactly orthogonal is not possible with polynomial spectral filter functions. The result is an extension of the critically sampled framework of Narang and Ortega (2012). In this work we present a solution that is nearly orthogonal which has the advantage of giving a nearly tight transform, i.e. nearly equal frame bounds. A family of target functions which satisfy the orthogonality condition is constructed using Bernstein polynomials. The design of the spectral filters is easily achieved through an approximation of the target functions. Filters with good spectral characteristics that are nearly orthogonal can be easily obtained using the proposed method.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2514490","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7370889","Filter banks;graph wavelet;spectral graph theory","Transforms;Signal processing;Symmetric matrices;Chebyshev approximation;Bipartite graph;Shape","","4","","18","IEEE","4 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

So far, all existing formulations are real-valued and lack the concept of phase, which is inherent in inputs such as complex spectrograms or color images. Thus, in this letter, we extend principal component pursuit to the complex and quaternionic cases to account for the missing phase information. Specifically, we present both complex and quaternionic proximity operators for the ℓ1- and trace-norm regularizers. These operators can be used in conjunction with proximal minimization methods such as the inexact augmented Lagrange multiplier algorithm. The new algorithms are then applied to the singing voice separation problem, which aims to separate the singing voice from the instrumental accompaniment. Results on the iKala and MSD100 datasets confirmed the usefulness of phase information in principal component pursuit.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2514845","Academia Career Development Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7372422","Quaternions;principal component;pursuit algorithms;source separation;Principal component;pursuit algorithms;quaternions;source separation","Quaternions;Signal processing algorithms;Spectrogram;Source separation;Instruments","","15","","30","IEEE","5 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the prior literature, the relay is assumed to always use its full transmit power in a TW FD relay network. However, high transmit power will increase loopback self-interference at the relay node and thus make the incoming link to the relay become the bottleneck for the end-to-end performance. Therefore, it is suboptimal to always utilize the full power capability of the relay. Thus, we propose three relay power control schemes, which can, respectively, maximize 1) the data rate of an individual end node, 2) the minimum data rate of the two end nodes, and 3) the sum data rate of the two end nodes. Numerical results show that, compared to using full relay power, the proposed relay power control schemes can improve system performance while reducing relay power consumption.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2517020","State Major Science and Technology Special Projects(grant numbers:2016ZX03002020-005); National High Technology Research and Development Program (863 Program) of China(grant numbers:2014AA01A707); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7378900","Full duplex;two-way relay;power control;Full duplex;power control;two-way relay","Power control;Materials requirements planning;Relay networks (telecommunications);Interference;Signal to noise ratio;High definition video","","20","","15","IEEE","12 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is a well known signal processing problem that has many applications in areas such as financial data analysis, climatology, biological and medical sciences. Mean filtering finds a piece-wise constant trend in the data while trend filtering finds a piece-wise linear trend. When the signal is noisy, the main difficulty is finding the changing points in the data that mark the transition points when the mean or the trend changes. Previously proposed methods based on ℓ1 filtering suffer from the occurrence of false changing points in the estimate. This is known as the stair-case effect. The main contribution in this paper is incorporating a technique to remove these false changing points to a fast mean filtering algorithm, referred to as the taut-string method, resulting in an efficient procedure with accurate change point detection and thus the removal of the stair-case effect.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2517605","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7378883","l1 mean filtering;taut-string algorithm;stair-case effect;${\ell _1}$ mean filtering;stair-case effect;taut-string algorithm","Market research;Signal processing algorithms;Time series analysis;Noise measurement;Difference equations;Signal processing;Data models","","6","","19","IEEE","12 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
