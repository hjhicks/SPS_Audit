"Fast Distribution Fitting for Parameter Estimation of Range-Weighted Neighborhood Filters","C. -T. Huang","National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,"3 Feb 2016","2016","23","3","331","335","The range variance of neighborhood filters is well estimated via distribution fitting of a chi scale mixtures model proposed in our previous work. However, it introduced computation overheads for deriving empirical distributions and performing iterative fitting. In this letter, we discuss how to greatly reduce the overheads for practical usage while maintaining denoising quality. For empirical distributions, a grid-subsampling strategy is adopted for acceleration. Regarding distribution fitting, two different methods are studied: equal-frequency merged distribution and L-moment fitting. The former reformulates the fitting process into entropy optimization for only few merged bins. It provides 6-13x speedup for model fitting with negligible quality loss and 9-20x speedup with ≤ 0.1 dB PSNR drop by using 20 and 10 bins respectively. The latter performs table lookup of L-moments, instead of conventional moments, for robust fitting of heavy-tailed distributions. The fitting time then becomes negligible with ≤ 0.2 dB drop in most cases, e.g. the overall run time for bilateral 9 × 9 filtering can be thus accelerated by around 6x. Experiments on bilateral and non-local means filters are also given to show the speedup, quality and robustness.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2517668","Ministry of Science and Technology(grant numbers:103-2218-E-007-008-MY3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7381640","Bilateral filter;non-local means;denoising;empirical Bayesian;L-moment;parameter estimation;Bilateral filter;denoising;empirical Bayesian;L-moment;non-local means;parameter estimation","Robustness;Parameter estimation;Acceleration;Complexity theory;Noise reduction;Kernel;Noise measurement","","3","","12","IEEE","13 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In such a scenario time synchronization is crucial to efficiently operate in duty-cycles and minimize energy consumption. In this work we assess the impact of the trade-off between spending energy with more frequent synchronizations and in return saving it by reducing the idle listening window necessary for the desired reliability of the communication. The optimal frequency of time synchronizations is obtained analytically and corroborated by numerical results, showing that several times less overall energy may be spent with a finer synchronization when compared with maintaining the minimum clock precision required by the phenomenon being monitored, greatly extending the life-span of the network.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2515580","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7374658","Clock synchronization;energy efficiency;event detection;wireless sensor networks","Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks;Monitoring;Energy consumption;Electronic mail;Optimization","","10","","15","IEEE","7 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The basic idea lies in generating a short random key that is used to shuffle/interleave information at the source, Alice. This key is then sent to the legitimate receiver, Bob, during a brief period of advantageous communication over the eavesdropper Eve (e.g., due to more interference from a jammer). Finally, the key is decoded at Bob to properly deinterleave the original information. Bob receives a better quality version of the interleaving key, therefore having the needed advantage over Eve. Information reliability is provided by a strong inner code, while security against Eve results from the proper selection of the outer code and interference levels over the key. We propose a methodology for selection of the outer code with reliability and security constraints. For that, we introduce bit error complementary cumulative distribution function metrics, suitable for security and reliability analysis of error correcting codes.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2015.2511821","iCIS project(grant numbers:CENTRO-07-ST24-FEDER-002003); Instituto de Telecomunicações(grant numbers:PEst-UID/EEA/50008/2013); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7364175","wireless, secrecy;finite blocklength;coding;interleaving;jamming;Coding;finite blocklength;interleaving;jamming;secrecy;wireless","Jamming;Encoding;Reliability;Security;Decoding;Interference;Communication system security","","18","1","19","IEEE","23 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We formalize the KFB with a set of linear constraints and present its equivalence to the linearly constrained minimum power (LCMP) beamformer. We further show that the optimal output power, required for implementing the KFB, is merely controlling the white noise gain (WNG) of the beamformer.

These two steps aim to provide better SPN with higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and therefore improve the identification performance.

With this a person is taking visual measurements about the world in a sequence of fixations which contain relevant information about the most salient parts of the environment and the goals of the actor. We present a novel model for gaze prediction in egocentric video based on the spatiotemporal visual information captured from the wearer's camera, specifically extended using a subjective function of surprise by means of motion memory, referring to the human aspect of visual attention. Spatiotemporal saliency detection is computed in a bioinspired framework using a superposition of superpixel- and contrast based conspicuity maps as well as an optical flow based motion saliency map. Motion is further processed into a motion novelty map that is constructed by a comparison between most recent motion information with an exponentially decreasing memory of motion information. The innovative motion novelty map is experienced to be able to provide a significant increase in the performance of gaze prediction. Experimental results are gained from egocentric videos using eye-tracking glasses in a natural shopping task and prove a 6.48% increase in the mean saliency at a fixation in terms of a measure of mimicking human attention.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2523339","Slovakian(grant numbers:VEGA 1/0625/14); Austrian Research Promotion Agency(grant numbers:832045); Research Studio Austria FACTS; Austrian Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7394123","Computer vision;Image processing;Feature extraction;Image motion analysis;Machine vision;Computer vision;feature extraction;image motion analysis;image processing;machine vision","Spatiotemporal phenomena;Histograms;Visualization;Computational modeling;Optical signal processing;Dynamics;Cameras","","12","","22","IEEE","28 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
