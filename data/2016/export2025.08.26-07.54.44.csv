The source signal is assumed deterministic unknown. Global errors are predicted by deriving exact expressions of pairwise error probabilities with model mismatch in conjunction with the use of the Union bound.

This paper approaches such blind estimation task (for which classical identification tools are unsuitable) by bringing into the Bayesian framework a Hammerstein system model: the cascade of a static memoryless nonlinearity with a memory-inducing linear filter, which has been shown to be effective in describing many real systems. By assuming the underlying clean audio signal is autoregressive in short sections, the proposed method identifies the distorting system by simulating, in a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo context, the posterior distribution of the model parameters conditioned on the distorted signal. To deal with the resulting non-standard posterior distribution, a combination of the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm and the Gibbs Sampling is adopted. MH proposals are based on the Laplace approximation of the posterior distribution thanks to its almost Gaussian shape around modes. A heuristic that forces a broad region of the parameter space to be visited on an occasional basis prevents the Markov Chain from getting stuck around local maxima. A series of experiments with artificially distorted music recordings attests the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2525005","CNPq and FAPERJ; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7397911","Nonlinear distortion;Bayesian inference;MCMC;Hammerstein system;Audio restoration;Audio restoration;Bayesian inference;Hammerstein system;MCMC;nonlinear distortion","Nonlinear distortion;Bayes methods;Yttrium;Context;Context modeling;Signal processing algorithms","","7","","15","IEEE","3 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For most SCA methods to achieve good performance, the measured leakages are often desired to be well aligned. However, due to some specific reasons such as inaccurate measurements or carefully designed countermeasures, misalignment of leakages frequently occurs in practice. Misalignment significantly reduces the efficiency of SCA methods, or even makes them fail. To address this issue, two alignment approaches are proposed: a local alignment based on shotgun distance and a global alignment based on weighted edit distance. Compared with previous methods, the proposed methods are capable of keeping the secret dependant leakages, while not introducing any redundant information. In addition, the proposed methods could also reduce the negative effects of noise, which is another factor seriously decreasing the efficiency of SCA methods. Interestingly, it is pretty easy to set appropriate parameters for these two methods. Practical experiments show that the proposed methods outperform previous methods in three different circumstances and different noise levels.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2521441","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61472416,61272478,61170282); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:XDA06010701); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7390189","Side channel attacks;alignment;shotgun distance;weighted edit distance;anti-noise performance;Alignment;anti-noise performance;shotgun distance;side channel attacks;weighted edit distance","Signal processing algorithms;Cryptography;Economic indicators;Quantization (signal);Algorithm design and analysis;Performance evaluation","","7","","21","IEEE","25 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, we study the sparse formulation (‚Ñì2-norm) and illustrate that as long as the ‚Ñì0-norm of the sparse representation of the host signal is less than the signal's dimension in the original domain, an informed sparse domain data hiding system can be established by modifying the coefficients of the atoms that have not participated in representing the host signal.

For the hierarchical distribution associated with spherical invariant random variables, the BCRB has a compact closed-form expression and enjoys several interesting properties that are discussed.

The problem of extracting long-range motion trajectories is changed to the issue of consistency of mesh evolution over time. First, self-occlusion is detected by a novel mesh-based method and an adaptive motion estimation method is proposed to initialize mesh between successive frames.

In this work, we provide a branch and bound algorithm for finding the globally optimal base station clustering. The algorithm is mainly intended for benchmarking existing suboptimal clustering schemes. We propose a general model for the user throughputs, which only depends on the long-term CSI statistics. The model assumes intracluster interference alignment and is able to account for the CSI acquisition overhead. By enumerating a search tree using a best-first search and pruning sub-trees in which the optimal solution provably cannot be, the proposed method converges to the optimal solution. The pruning is done using specifically derived bounds, which exploit some assumed structure in the throughput model.

It is an important analytical tool, providing theoretic limits for near-optimum transceiver design. Next generation wireless communications systems with the use of new technologies, such as massive antennas and nonorthogonal waveforms, tend to be large scale. However, the conventional ways developed for evaluating the CM capacity of small-scale systems expose exponential complexity with respect to the system's input dimension. Therefore, they become infeasible when the input dimension increases by one or two orders of magnitude in large-scale systems of interest. This letter resorts to a lower and upper bound of the CM capacity, allowing for a computationally efficient evaluation with polynomial complexity. In particular, two message passing algorithms, namely expectation propagation (EP) and variational message passing (VMP), are applied to evaluate the bounds. Two applications are examined in the end.
