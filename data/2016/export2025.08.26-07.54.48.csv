Previous approaches based on shiftable approximation have, however, been restricted to Gaussian range kernels. In this work, we propose a novel approximation that can be applied to any range kernel, provided it has a pointwise-convergent Fourier series. More specifically, we propose to approximate the Gaussian range kernel of the bilateral filter using a Fourier basis, where the coefficients of the basis are obtained by solving a series of least-squares problems. The coefficients can be efficiently computed using a recursive form of the QR decomposition. By controlling the cardinality of the Fourier basis, we can obtain a good tradeoff between the run-time and the filtering accuracy. In particular, we are able to guarantee subpixel accuracy for the overall filtering, which is not provided by the most existing methods for fast bilateral filtering. We present simulation results to demonstrate the speed and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2539982","Indian Institute of Science; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7429737","bilateral filter;shiftability;Fourier basis;Accuracy;bilateral filter;fast algorithm;Fourier basis;shiftability","Kernel;Approximation algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Filtering;Fourier series;Convolution;Algorithm design and analysis","","53","","24","IEEE","9 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In contrast to the traditional least-squares regression (LSR) method, the major novelty of DaLSR is that it is able to handle the mismatch problem between source and target speech corpora. Hence, the proposed DaLSR method is very suitable for coping with cross-corpus SER problem. For evaluating the performance of the proposed method in dealing with the cross-corpus SER problem, we conduct extensive experiments on three emotional speech corpora and compare the results with several state-of-the-art transfer learning methods that are widely used for cross-corpus SER problem.

This work discusses the algorithmic procedures and codec modifications necessary to combine all of the above features-transform length, window shape, transform kernel, and overlap ratio switching-into a flexible input-adaptive coding system. It is shown that, due to full time-domain aliasing cancelation, this system supports perfect signal reconstruction in the absence of quantization and, thanks to fast realizations of all transforms, increases the codec complexity only negligibly.

Sample entropy (SE), though powerful, is not fast enough, especially for long signals. Permutation entropy (PE), as a broadly used irregularity indicator, considers only the order of the amplitude values and hence some information regarding the amplitudes may be discarded. To tackle these problems, we introduce a new method, termed dispersion entropy (DE), to quantify the regularity of time series. We gain insight into the dependency of DE on several straightforward signal-processing concepts via a set of synthetic time series. The results show that DE, unlike PE, can detect the noise bandwidth and simultaneous frequency and amplitude change. We also employ DE to three publicly available real datasets. The simulations on real-valued signals show that the DE method considerably outperforms PE to discriminate different groups of each dataset. In addition, the computation time of DE is significantly less than that of SE and PE.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2542881","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7434608","Dispersion entropy;signal regularity;nonlinear dynamics;Dispersion entropy (DE);nonlinear dynamics;signal regularity","Dispersion;Entropy;Time series analysis;Delay effects;Bandwidth;Chirp;Reliability","","641","","24","IEEE","16 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The construction provides a mapping that has relatively simply transformation properties under spatial rotations, and the distance values can be computed with the help of closed-form expressions which allow an efficient implementation.

The underlying rationale for this is to develop a model for a “quasi-Gaussian” RV—an RV that is nominally Gaussian, but with mean and variance parameters that are not constant, but instead, are RVs themselves. Due to the central limit theorem, many “real-world” processes are modeled as being Gaussian distributed.

In the proposed method, the principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimension of the received signals from both intercell and intracell. Then, the complex independent component analysis (ICA) is implemented to estimate the channels, and the mean minimum square error (MMSE) decoder is employed to decode the transmitted signals. At last, few pilot signals are used to overcome the ambiguity caused by the complex ICA. In our method, orthogonality or asymptotic orthogonality of the channels is not required. Moreover, the path-loss and shadowing factors can be unknown. Simulation results show that the performance of our decoder is better than the MMSE channel estimation-based MMSE decoder. Moreover, error floor does not appear even when signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is high, while it occurs if the MMSE decoder is used.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2545105","National Natural Science Foundations of China(grant numbers:61372093,61401133); Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Network Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7438799","pilot contamination;pilot signals;PCA;ICA;semi-blind decoding;multi-cell massive MIMO system;Independent component analysis (ICA);multicell massive multiple-input;multiple-output (MIMO) system;pilot contamination;pilot signals;principal component analysis (PCA);semi-blind decoding","Channel estimation;Decoding;Principal component analysis;MIMO;Contamination;Antennas;Signal to noise ratio","","12","","15","IEEE","22 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A couple of inherent TD constraints, which are otherwise handled as ad hoc exceptions, has also been incorporated using NMF, including line spectral frequency (LSF) ordering and monotonic event functions. Here, these constraints are analyzed and a third inherent constraint is incorporated into an NMF analysis. This is the complementarity in the sense that two overlapping event functions uniformly add up to one, which has been handled, at best, by a quadratic penalty term. We propose the use of an augmented Lagrangian including a term with the Lagrange multipliers (LMs). Additionally, a multiplicative update rule for the LMs is proposed, which fits nicely into the nature of NMF updates. Further, previous difficulties with nonsmooth spectral envelopes have been resolved by obtaining the spectral envelopes from TANDEM-STRAIGHT spectrograms.

We exploit the second-order statistics of observations and introduce a novel BSS method, termed as underdetermined joint blind source separation (UJBSS). Considering the dependence information between two datasets, the problem of jointly estimating the mixing matrices is tackled via canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition of a specialized tensor in which a set of spatial covariance matrices are stacked. Furthermore, the estimated mixing matrices are used to recover the sources from each dataset separately.

After that, a coarse saliency map is obtained by integrating the four adjusted Mahalanobis distance maps, each of which is formed by the distances between all the patches and background in the corresponding SBD. To be more discriminative, the coarse saliency map is further enhanced into the posterior probability map within Bayesian perspective. Finally, the final saliency map is generated by properly refining the posterior probability map with geodesic distance.

As new techniques become available, it will be useful to apply them to existing microarray images to obtain more accurate results. The compression of these images can be a useful tool to alleviate the costs associated to their storage and transmission. The recently proposed Relative Quantizer (RQ) coder provides the most competitive lossy compression ratios while introducing only acceptable changes in the images. However, images compressed with the RQ coder can only be reconstructed with a limited quality, determined before compression. In this work, a progressive lossy-to-lossless scheme is presented to solve this problem. First, the regular structure of the RQ intervals is exploited to define a lossy-to-lossless coding algorithm called the Progressive RQ (PRQ) coder. Second, an enhanced version that prioritizes a region of interest, called the PRQ-region of interest (ROI) coder, is described. Experiments indicate that the PRQ coder offers progressivity with lossless and lossy coding performance almost identical to the best techniques in the literature, none of which is progressive. In turn, the PRQ-ROI exhibits very similar lossless coding results with better rate-distortion performance than both the RQ and PRQ coders.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2547893","European Regional Development Fund (FEDER); Spanish Government Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO); Catalan Government(grant numbers:TIN2015-71126-R,TIN2012-38102-C03-03,FPU AP2010-0172,2014SGR-691); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7442802","DNA microarray images;Image compression;Quantization;DNA microarray images;image compression;quantization","Image coding;Quantization (signal);DNA;Indexes;Image reconstruction;Context;Signal processing algorithms","","9","","38","IEEE","29 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, we propose a novel method that uses the spatial context to help tracking based on support vector machines (SVMs). The spatial context is decomposed into different subregions that include some parts of both the target and the background. We build appearance submodels for each group of subregions and combine them to get a robust appearance model, which can help to handle some complex problems, e.g., occlusion and deformation. Besides, we add an update strategy to retain the accuracy of the appearance model. A large number of experiments on various challenging videos demonstrate that our method outperforms many other state-of-the-art methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2550493","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61132007,U1533132); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7447707","Object tracking;spatial context;combination of sub-models;SVM;Combination of submodels;object tracking;spatial context;support vector machine (SVM)","Context;Target tracking;Support vector machines;Object tracking;Context modeling;Sun;Deformable models","","2","","23","IEEE","5 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For discrete signals with structured sparse Haar wavelet coefficients, we give the first proof of near-optimal recovery from discrete Fourier samples taken according to an appropriate variable density sampling scheme. Crucially, in taking into account such structured sparsity-known as sparsity in levels-as opposed to just sparsity, this result yields recovery guarantees that agree with the empirically observed recovery properties of CS in this setting. This result complements a recent theorem in Adcock et al. [Breaking the coherence barrier: A new theory for compressed sensing, arXiv preprint arXiv: 1302.0561, 2014.], which addressed the case of continuous time signals. Moreover, we provide a significantly shorter and more expositional argument, which clearly illustrates the key factors governing recovery in this setting: namely the division of frequency space into dyadic bands corresponding to wavelet scales, the near-block diagonality of the Fourier/wavelet cross-Gramian matrix, and the structured sparsity of wavelet coefficients.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2550101","Alfred P.

An ideal, noise-free setting is considered whereby each sensor can perfectly detect if the target is in its close proximity or not. Only those detecting sensors communicate their decisions and locations to a fusion center (FC), which subsequently forms the desired location estimator based on censored observations. Because a maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) does not exist in this setting, current approaches have relied on heuristic, centrality-based geometric estimators such as the center of a minimum enclosing circle (CMEC). A smooth surrogate to the likelihood function is proposed here, whose maximizer is shown to approach the CMEC asymptotically as the likelihood approximation error vanishes. This provides rigorous analytical justification as to why the CMEC estimator outperforms other heuristics for this problem, as empirically observed in prior studies. Since the Cramér-Rao Bound does not exist either, an upshot of the results in this letter is that the CMEC performance can be adopted as a benchmark in this ideal setting and also for comparison with other more pragmatic binary localization methods in the presence of uncertainty.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2550421","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7447742","Non-cooperative localization;ideal binary detectors;centrality estimators;performance analysis;Centrality estimators;ideal binary detectors;noncooperative localization;performance analysis","Maximum likelihood estimation;Wireless sensor networks;Smoothing methods;Approximation error;Uncertainty;Detectors","","8","","30","IEEE","5 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, in practice, the characteristics of the clutter can vary enormously depending on the radar-operational scenarios. If unaccounted for, these nonstationary variabilities may drastically hinder the radar performance. Therefore, to overcome such shortcomings, we develop a data-driven method for target detection in nonstationary environments. In this method, the radar dynamically detects changes in the environment and adapts to these changes by learning the new statistical characteristics of the environment and by intelligibly updating its statistical detection algorithm. Specifically, we employ drift detection algorithms to detect changes in the environment; incremental learning, particularly learning under concept drift algorithms, to learn the new statistical characteristics of the environment from the new radar data that become available in batches over a period of time. The newly learned environment characteristics are then integrated in the detection algorithm. We use Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that the developed method provides a significant improvement in the detection performance compared with detection techniques that are not aware of the environmental changes.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2553042","U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; U.S. Department of Energy(grant numbers:DE-AC05-00OR22725); AFOSR(grant numbers:FA9550-11-1-0210); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7451218","Data-driven adaptive radar;cognitive radar;nonstationary environment;incremental learning;active drift learning;Active drift learning;cognitive radar;data-driven adaptive radar;incremental learning;nonstationary environment","Clutter;Radar detection;Object detection;Radar measurements;Signal processing algorithms;Detection algorithms","","17","","37","IEEE","12 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
