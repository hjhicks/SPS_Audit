The key contribution is the design of a novel and highly discriminative face image descriptor called bag of dense derivative depth patterns (Bag-D3P). This descriptor is composed of four different stages that fully exploit the characteristics of depth information: 1) dense spatial derivatives to encode the 3-D local structure; 2) face-adaptive quantization of the previous derivatives; 3) multibag of words that creates a compact vector description from the quantized derivatives; and 4) spatial block division to add global spatial information. The proposed system can recognize people faces from a wide range of poses, not only frontal ones, increasing its applicability to real situations. Last, a new face database of high-resolution depth images has been created and made it public for evaluation purposes.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2553784","Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad of the Spanish Government under Project(grant numbers:TEC2013-48453); AIRBUS Defense and Space under Project SAVIER; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7452392","Depth camera;dense depth derivatives;quantized patterns;face recognition;depth face database;SVM;bag-of-words;Bag of words;dense depth derivatives;depth camera;depth face database;face recognition;quantized patterns;support vector machine (SVM)","Face;Face recognition;Three-dimensional displays;Image resolution;Support vector machines;Cameras;Lighting","","16","","23","IEEE","13 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

SHARP processing extends a previous algorithm called Suppression of Slowly varying components and the Falling edge (SSF), which suppresses the steady-state portions of subband spectral envelopes. The SSF algorithm tends to over-subtract these envelopes in highly reverberant environments when there are high levels of power in previous analysis frames. The proposed SHARP method prevents excessive suppression both by boosting the floor value using the harmonics in voiced speech segments and by inhibiting the subtraction for unvoiced speech by detecting frames in which power is concentrated in high-frequency channels. These modifications enable the SHARP algorithm to improve recognition accuracy by further reducing the mismatch between power contours of clean and reverberated speech. Experimental results indicate that the SHARP method provides better recognition accuracy in highly reverberant environments compared to the SSF algorithm. It is also shown that the performance of the SHARP method can be further improved by combining it with feature-space maximum likelihood linear regression (fMLLR).","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2554888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7453142","Robust speech recognition;reverberation;precedence effect;harmonics;Harmonics;precedence effect;reverberation;robust speech recognition","Speech;Speech processing;Harmonic analysis;Power system harmonics;Speech recognition;Indexes;Signal processing algorithms","","3","","17","IEEE","15 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The feasibility of CP-based maximum-likelihood (ML) blind synchronization for GFDM systems, however, has not been assessed in the literature. We find that such synchronization is complicated by the covariance structure of the signal which, due to nonorthogonal pulse shaping, possesses a time-varying signal power and some weak self-induced interference. Neglecting the latter and approximating the former by the average power enable us to obtain an approximate-ML solution based on a recent result on OFDM synchronization in wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) channels.

In this letter, we propose a new semisupervised multilabel classification algorithm with joint dimensionality reduction. First, an elaborate matrix is designed for evaluating instance similarity; thus, it can take both labeled and unlabeled instances into consideration. Second, a linear dimensionality reduction matrix is added into the framework of multilabel classification. Besides, the dimensionality reduction matrix and the objective function can be optimized simultaneously. Finally, we design an efficient algorithm to solve the dual problem of the proposed model.

First, we propose a measure to evaluate the reliability of depth map, and use it to reduce the influence of poor depth map on saliency detection. Then, the input image is represented as a graph, and the depth information is introduced into graph construction. After that, a new definition of compactness using color and depth cues is put forward to compute the compactness saliency map. In order to compensate the detection errors of compactness saliency when the salient regions have similar appearances with background, foreground saliency map is calculated based on depth-refined foreground seeds' selection (DRSS) mechanism and multiple cues contrast. Finally, these two saliency maps are integrated into a final saliency map through weighted-sum method according to their importance. Experiments on two publicly available stereo data sets demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than other ten state-of-the-art approaches.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2557347","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61271324,61520106002,91320201); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7457641","Depth confidence measure;color and depthbased compactness;multiple cues;saliency detection;Color and depth-based compactness;depth confidence measure;multiple cues;saliency detection","Image color analysis;Computational modeling;Stereo image processing;Reliability;Visualization;Manifolds;Markov processes","","205","","32","OAPA","21 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

From a least-squares cost function, the gradient is calculated following results from geometric calculus (GC), the extension of GA to handle differential and integral calculus. The novel GA least-mean-squares (GA-LMS) adaptive filter, which inherits properties from standard adaptive filters and from GA, is developed to recursively estimate a rotor (multivector), a hypercomplex quantity able to describe rotations in any dimension. The adaptive filter (AF) performance is assessed via a 3-D point-clouds registration problem, which contains a rotation estimation step. Calculating the AF computational complexity suggests that it can contribute to reduce the cost of a full-blown 3-D registration algorithm, especially when the number of points to be processed grows. Moreover, the employed GA/GC framework allows for easily applying the resulting filter to estimating rotors in higher dimensions.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2558461","CAPES Foundation, Ministry of Education of Brazil(grant numbers:BEX 14601/13-3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7460183","Adaptive Filters;Geometric Algebra;3D Registration;Point Cloud Alignment;3-D registration;adaptive filters (AFs);geometric algebra (GA);point cloud alignment","Quaternions;Algebra;Three-dimensional displays;Calculus;Rotors;Estimation;Standards","","30","","33","IEEE","27 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, we propose a novel algorithm for multisensor multitarget tracking that is scalable w.r.t. the number of sensors. Our approach is based on the class of marginalized δ-generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli (Mδ-GLMB) densities, which can be used to define a principled approximation to the δGLMB density representing the true posterior in the sense of the multitarget Bayes filter. We derive the update equations of an MδGLMB density that matches the δ-GLMB density in cardinality distribution and first moment, as well as minimizes the Kullback- Leibler divergence w.r.t. the true δ-GLMB density over the class of Mδ-GLMB densities. The proposed Mδ-GLMB density is then used to define an approximate multisensor sequential update step. Simulations in multisensor scenarios with radar and range-only measurements verify the applicability of the proposed approach.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2557078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7457284","Finite set statistics (FISST);generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli (GLMB);marginalized δ-GLMB (Mδ-GLMB);multisensor;random finite set (RFS);Finite set statistics (FISST);generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli (GLMB);marginalized δ-GLMB (Mδ-GLMB);multisensor;random finite set (RFS)","Sensors;Radar tracking;Mathematical model;Complexity theory;Indexes;Approximation algorithms;History","","59","","36","IEEE","20 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This method is general and works for any APSK (two-dimensional) constellation. By pruning the search tree, it also provides a mechanism for performance-complexity tradeoff and we show that its complexity is much lower than a previously published scheme (which only works for regular APSK constellations).","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2560241","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7462233","Amplitude phase shift keying;demodulation;maximum likelihood detection","Labeling;Demodulation;Complexity theory;Constellation diagram;Phase shift keying;Digital video broadcasting;Table lookup","","12","1","8","IEEE","28 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In such a system, FD capable base station (FD-BS) is designed to transmit data to one downlink user and concurrently receive data from one uplink user, while one idle user harvests the radio-frequency (RF) signals' energy to extend its lifetime. Moreover, to prevent eavesdropping, artificial noise (AN) is exploited by FD-BS to degrade the channel of the idle user, as well as to provide energy supply to the idle user. To maximize the weighted sum of downlink secrecy rate and uplink secrecy rate, we jointly optimize the information covariance matrix, AN covariance matrix, and receiver vector, under the constraints of the sum transmission power of FD-BS and the minimum harvested energy of the idle user. Since the problem is nonconvex, the log-exponential reformulation and sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) method are used. Extensive simulation results are provided and demonstrate that our proposed FD scheme extremely outperforms the half-duplex scheme.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2553171","National 863 Project(grant numbers:2014AA01A705); National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61431003,61421061); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7451213","Wireless information and power transfer;physical layer security;full duplex;convex optimization;Convex optimization;full duplex (FD);physical layer security;wireless information and power transfer","Uplink;Downlink;Silicon;Receiving antennas;Covariance matrices;Interference","","40","","19","IEEE","12 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most existing cross-view hashing methods learn binary codes with continuous relaxations, which cause large quantization loss across views. To address this problem, in this letter, we propose a novel cross-view hashing method, where a common Hamming space is learned such that binary codes from different views are consistent and comparable. The quantization loss across views is explicitly reduced by two carefully designed regression terms from original spaces to the Hamming space. In our method, the l2,1-norm regularization is further exploited for discriminative feature selection. To obtain high-quality binary codes, we propose to jointly learn the codes and hash functions, for which an efficient iterative algorithm is presented. We evaluate the proposed method, dubbed Robust Cross-view Hashing (RCH), on two benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate the superiority of RCH over many other state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval performance and cross-view consistency.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2517093","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61273251,61402203); Doctoral Candidate Innovation Project Fund of Jiangsu province(grant numbers:KYLX_0385); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7378887","Cross-view;Hashing;Multimedia retrieval;Cross-view;hashing;multimedia retrieval","Binary codes;Quantization (signal);Optimization;Yttrium;Robustness;Multimedia communication;Electronic mail","","16","","27","IEEE","12 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
