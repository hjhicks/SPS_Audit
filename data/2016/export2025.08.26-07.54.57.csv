"Decimation Double-Phase Estimator: An Efficient and Unambiguous High-Order Binary Offset Carrier Tracking Algorithm","T. Feng","National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,"23 May 2016","2016","23","7","905","909","Traditional binary offset carrier (BOC) tracking algorithms process the upper and lower sideband signals together, and thus, the sampling frequency and computational requirements are much higher than that required for binary phase-shift keying tracking algorithms, especially for high-order BOC signals. Addressing existing limitations, this letter proposes a decimation double-phase estimator (DDPE) tracking algorithm for BOC signals. The algorithm uses a normal carrier and a subcarrier with a constant frequency to shift the upper and lower sideband signals of BOC to the zero frequency and decimates the signal before processing by the correlator. The residual carrier and the subcarrier are then tracked by the double-phase estimator algorithm. Decimating the signals significantly reduces the computational complexity, and for a BOC(6n, n) signal, the DDPE is found to reduce 86% of correlator operations with a signal-to-noise ratio loss of 0.5 dB.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2565511","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7467482","BOC signal;decimation double-phase estimator;unambiguous tracking;low computational complexity;Binary offset carrier (BOC) signal;decimation double-phase estimator (DDPE);low computational complexity;unambiguous tracking","Signal processing algorithms;Signal to noise ratio;Tracking loops;Bandwidth;Algorithm design and analysis;Computational complexity;Correlation","","13","","10","IEEE","10 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To that end, a coarse frequency estimation is obtained using the windowing approach, known to reduce the estimation bias, and then used to filter out the negative-frequency component via modulation and discrete Fourier transform bin excision approach. Fine estimation is performed using accurate frequency estimators, developed for complex sinusoids, on the filtered signal. The proposed method is characterized by the $ O(N\log _2N)$ complexity in terms of additions/multiplications and the $ O(N)$ complexity in terms of sine/cosine operations and comparisons.

In this paper, we consider a multi-user MIMO system with hardware calibration errors (CaEs) at the BS and derive robust Bayesian precoders that minimize inter-user interference using the UL CSI and CaEs statistics as side information. The proposed robust precoding outperforms conventional non-robust precoding, and its gains compared to non-robust precoding increase with increasing numbers of users and CaEs. Furthermore, robust precoding can be used to relax calibration requirements, which is a result of practical interest.

Compared with the commonly used additive error model, the phase error model is more suitable for capturing the uncertainty in an LOS propagation channel, as the dominant source of uncertainty lies in the phase. We consider a multiple-input single-output multicast scenario, in which our goal is to design a beamformer that minimizes the transmit power while satisfying probabilistic signal-to-noise ratio constraints. In particular, the probabilistic constraints give rise to a new computational challenge, as they involve random trigonometric forms. In this study, we propose to first approximate the random trigonometric form by its second-order Taylor expansion and then tackle the resulting random quadratic form using a Bernstein-type inequality. It follows that an approximately optimal beamformer can be obtained using the standard semidefinite relaxation technique. Such a design approach is applicable to both independent and correlated phase errors. In the simulations, we first show that if a nonrobust design (i.e., one that does not take phase errors into account) is used; then, the whole system may collapse. We then show that our proposed method is less conservative than the existing robust design based on Gaussian approximation and thus requires a lower power budget.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2569600","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7470608","Beamforming;line-of-sight (LOS);MISO;multicast;phase error;robust","Probabilistic logic;Modeling;Robustness;Array signal processing;Signal to noise ratio;Receivers","","34","","11","IEEE","18 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The phase projection images typically have higher fidelity and hence are used for tomographic reconstruction. In practice, three-dimensional tomographic reconstruction can be challenging because the measurements may have outliers, a fluctuating background and may be restricted to a limited angular range of sample rotations. Thus, conventional reconstruction algorithms such as filtered back projection can result in reconstructions with strong artifacts. In this paper, we present a robust model-based iterative reconstruction algorithm for X-ray ptychography-based phase tomography. Our method casts the reconstruction as a regularized inverse problem, involving a novel data fitting term that accounts for noise, the fluctuating background as well as outliers, combined with an image model term that enforces regularity on the volume to be reconstructed. We use a majorization-minimization strategy to find a minimum of the formulated cost function. Reconstructions on a simulated as well as a real dataset show that it is possible to acquire high-quality phase reconstructions compared to the typically used filtered-back projection algorithm as well as conventional regularized inversion approaches.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2562504","Director, Office of Science; Office of Basic Energy Sciences; U.S. Department of Energy(grant numbers:DE-AC02-05CH11231); Center for Applied Mathematics for Energy Research Applications; ASCR-BES; U.S. Department of Energy(grant numbers:DOE-DE-AC03-76SF00098); A.H's DOE Early; Army Research Office(grant numbers:#W911NF1210491); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7464924","Computed tomography;iterative methods;ptychography;X-ray tomography;Computed tomography;iterative methods;ptychography;X-ray tomography","Image reconstruction;Tomography;Signal processing algorithms;Cost function;Phase measurement;Robustness","","14","","24","IEEE","4 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

More specifically, we use the newly proposed binarized normed gradient (BING) objectness as the base, and then train an object-adaptive objectness for each tracking task. The training is implemented by using an adaptive support vector machine that integrates information from the specific tracking target into the BING measure. We emphasize that the benefit of the proposed adaptive objectness, named ADOBING, is generic. To show this, we combine ADOBING with eight top performed trackers in recent evaluations. We run the ADOBING-enhanced trackers along with their base trackers on the CVPR2013 benchmark, and our methods consistently improve the base trackers both in overall performance and under all challenge factors. Noting that the way we integrate objectness in visual tracking is generic and straightforward, we expect even more improvement by using tracker-specific objectness.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2556706","NSF(grant numbers:IIS-1407156,IIS-1350521,IIS-1218156); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7457299","Model adaptation;objectness;object tracking;Model adaptation;objectness;object tracking","Target tracking;Visualization;Training;Object tracking;Support vector machines;Benchmark testing;Adaptation models","","33","","33","IEEE","20 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The dual-threshold-based method is used to detect GT frames from the input video. A pair of successive GT frames is used to extract the candidate RSs. All frames in the selected segment are processed to detect SC. To this end, temporal running average is used to filter out temporal variations. First- and second-order statistics are used to binarize the running average image, which is fed to optical character recognition stage for character recognition. The absence/presence of SC is used for replay/live frame labeling. The SC detection stage complements the GT detection process, therefore, a combination of both is expected to result in superior computational complexity and detection accuracy. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated on 22 videos of four different sports (e.g., Cricket, tennis, baseball, and basketball).

Due to this bias distortion artifacts (entrainment) are generated. In this letter, we present a method to detect tonal, high correlated parts of the input signal. In particular, the method is able to distinguish between correlation resulting from the input signal and from feedback path changes. A subband feedback cancellation system which applies decorrelation methods is the basis for the proposed method. Additionally, we suggest to use the correlation detection to increase the performance of the mentioned feedback cancellation system. The performance is measured by preventing entrainment and reacting to feedback path changes.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2575447","Excellence Initiative; Technische Universität Darmstadt; German Federal and State Governments; Graduate School of Computationng at Technische Universität Darmstadt; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7482781","Adaptive feedback cancellation;NLMS filter adaptation;adaptation control;variable step size;hearing aids;frequency shift;prediction error filter;correlation detection;Adaptation control;adaptive feedback cancellation (AFC);correlation detection;frequency shift (FS);hearing aids (HAs);NLMS filter adaptation;prediction error filter (PEF);variable step size","Correlation;Frequency control;Decorrelation;Stability analysis;Acoustics;Auditory system;Loudspeakers","","8","","11","IEEE","1 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The CoR is represented as an angle and the norm of residuals is considered as the corresponding weight of angle, which is used as the new steganalysis feature. In the proposed scheme, no quantization and truncation is required and the effective information of long-range dependencies among pixels is kept properly. Also, the dimensionality of feature is linear with the number of residuals. The accuracy of proposed scheme is evaluated on HUGO and WOW algorithms, and the experimental results show that the proposed CoR feature has superior performance at low embedding rate with lower dimensionality.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2575100","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61525203,61472235); Program of Shanghai Dawn Scholar(grant numbers:14SG36); Shanghai Academic Research Leader(grant numbers:16XD1401200); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai(grant numbers:16ZR1413100); Excellent University Young Teachers Training Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission(grant numbers:ZZsdl15105); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7482790","Steganalysis;residuals;contrast;angle;weight;Angle;contrast;residuals;steganalysis;weight","Feature extraction;Maximum likelihood detection;Nonlinear filters;Histograms;Quantization (signal);Fluctuations;Training","","23","","18","IEEE","1 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional method for accomplishing CPD is the alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm. Convergence of ALS is known to be slow, especially when some factor matrices of the tensor contain nearly collinear columns. We propose a novel variant of this technique, in which the factor matrices are partitioned into blocks, and each iteration jointly updates blocks of different factor matrices. Each partial optimization is quadratic and can be done in closed form. The algorithm alternates between different random partitionings of the matrices. As a result, a faster convergence is achieved. Another improvement can be obtained when the method is combined with the enhanced line search of Rajih et al. Complexity per iteration is between those of the ALS and the Levenberg–Marquardt (damped Gauss–Newton) method. It is important, however, that the idea of alternating quadratic optimization with partitioned factor matrices is general and can be applied to other variants of the tensor decomposition problems, e.g., when non-Gaussian additive noise is considered.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2577383","Czech Science Foundation(grant numbers:14-13713S); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7485893","","Tensile stress;Signal processing algorithms;Convergence;Partitioning algorithms;Matrix decomposition;Optimization;Complexity theory","","12","","15","IEEE","6 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, we propose a novel matching method, denoted by multi-view relevance metric learning with list-wise constraints (mvRMLLC), to integrate the spatio-temporal (i.e., OFEI) and appearance features. Unlike previous works, mvRMLLC assumes that multiple features are generated from different views with distinct data distributions, while their similarities should be globally consistent. Multiple similarity metrics are then learned and fused by maximizing their global consistency and simultaneously allowing local discrepancies. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that OFEI outperforms the state-of-the-art spatio-temporal features, and mvRMLLC could further enhance the overall performance significantly.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2574323","Hong Kong, Macao; Taiwan Science and Technology Cooperation Program of China(grant numbers:L2015TGA9004); Foundation for Innovative Research Groups; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61573045); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7480858","Metric learning;multi-view data fusion;person re-identification;spatio-temporal representation;Metric learning;multi-view data fusion;person re-identification;spatio-temporal representation","Feature extraction;Measurement;Optical imaging;Robustness;Wireless application protocol;Optical signal processing;Image motion analysis","","30","","46","IEEE","30 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Approaches based on reinforcement learning (RL) are popular in academia and have been empirically shown to exhibit much better performance than handcrafted policies. However, the policies trained using RL are mostly incomprehensible, thus limiting the deployments for commercial applications. Policy optimization using genetic algorithm (GA) is a relatively new approach to spoken DM. The most notable advantage of this approach is that the trained policies can be directly interpreted by human experts. In this letter, we make several contributions to the GA-based framework. First, a structural policy learning procedure is presented. Second, a new fitness estimation method based on fitted policy evaluation is proposed. Finally, combining with these methods, an online evolutionary policy learning algorithm is designed which is much more data efficient than direct policy search using Monte Carlo simulations. These proposed approaches are empirically evaluated and compared with several state-of-the-art methods in a simulated environment. The experiments show favorable results for our approach.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2574890","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11461141004,61271426,11504406,11590770,11590771,11590772,11590773,11590774); Strategic Priority Research Program; Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:XDA06030100,XDA06030500,XDA06040603); National 863 Program(grant numbers:2015AA016306); National 973 Program(grant numbers:2013CB329302); Key Science and Technology Project; Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region(grant numbers:201230118-3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7482741","Human--computer interaction;speech processing;genetic algorithms","Optimization;Signal processing algorithms;Genetic algorithms;Sociology;Statistics;Genetics;Estimation","","1","","31","IEEE","1 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared to traditional local stereo methods, the 3-D aggregation greatly improves the accuracy of results in slanted surfaces and occlusion areas while keeping excellent performance near depth discontinuities. We also propose an acceleration method that surprisingly improves the accuracy at the same time.
