The algorithm is based on the fact that the high-contrast edges in overlay text boundaries generate truncation error when subjected to JPEG compression. The regions containing high-contrast edges in a given test image are first identified using a discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain technique and a binary truncation error map is generated. The overlay text regions in the truncation error map are generally clustered and the cluster corresponding to a text line appears in a connected form. The initial detection is refined using connected component-based processing. Experimental results on a set of $300$ images taken from news videos show that the proposed method is effective in detection of overlay text with a good accuracy.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2581311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7492173","Text detection;image forensics;truncation error;Image forensics;text detection;truncation error (TE)","Finite wordlength effects;Discrete cosine transforms;Transform coding;Image coding;Image edge detection;Q-factor;Image forensics","","11","","16","IEEE","15 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Simulation results show that the CS-based method could be efficiently used to generate wide nulls using at least two elements. The interference rejection ratio achieved by the proposed method is 10-20 dB better than the existing solutions.

The instantaneous spectrum estimation involves zero-time windowing for improved temporal resolution and group-delay computation for improved spectral resolution, as compared to the traditional discrete-Fourier-transform-based spectrum estimation. The SMS features capture the spectral representation of the subband energy time trajectories, while the SCE features model the fluctuations in the subband energy time trajectories. The SMS captures both the short-term as well as long-term spectral characteristics of whispered speech and is known to provide good separation between speech and noise components. The correntropy features help capture the dynamics of the vocal tract system to discriminate noisy whisper from noise. Whisper speech detection experiments using support vector machine models and the proposed features indicate promising performance under low signal-to-noise conditions.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2580912","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7491318","Whispered speech detection;instantaneous spectrum analysis;zero-time windowing;group delay;modulation spectrum;correntropy;Correntropy;group delay;instantaneous spectrum analysis;modulation spectrum;whispered speech detection (WSD);zero-time windowing","Speech;Modulation;Feature extraction;Trajectory;Spectral analysis;Delays;Noise measurement","","4","","16","IEEE","14 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, such as in the HMM case, LDMs produce over-smoothed trajectories of speech parameters, resulting in muffled quality of synthetic speech. Inspired by a similar problem found in HMM-based speech synthesis, where the naturalness of the synthesized speech is greatly improved when the global variance (GV) is compensated, this paper proposes a novel speech parameter generation algorithm that considers GV in LDM-based speech synthesis.

This is certainly exemplified in the context of target detection with X-band maritime surveillance radar. This is due to the fact that if the underlying clutter amplitude model can be assumed to be Rayleigh distributed, then there is a large class of detection processes with the constant false alarm rate property that can be applied. This paper examines the Rayleigh approximation of the K-distribution, since the latter is a popular model in X-band maritime surveillance radar. With an application of ideas from information theory, and in particular the Kullback-Leibler divergence, it is possible to derive the optimal Rayleigh approximation for any given K-distribution. Consequently bounds are derived to measure this approximation. These bounds reveal a necessary interaction between the K-distribution parameters to achieve a good Rayleigh approximation. Some numerical results are included to provide a practical assessment of the approximation.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2582898","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7497007","Clutter model approximations;k-distribution;Kullback–Leibler divergence;rayleigh distribution","Clutter;Shape;Random variables;Surveillance;Radar;Distribution functions;Upper bound","","22","","25","Crown","21 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The texture transferring is adapted to local characteristic (i.e., variance of the local patches) for a reduction of color smearing caused by large prediction error especially along edges.

However, DNN-based approaches are unable to achieve remarkable performance improvements for speech with severe distortion in the test environments different from training environments. In this letter, we propose a DNN-based FE method where the DNN inputs include preenhanced spectral features computed from multichannel input signals to reconstruct noise-robust features. The preenhanced spectral features are obtained by direction-of-arrival (DOA)-constrained independent component analysis (DCICA) followed by Bayesian FE using a hidden-Markov-model prior, to exploit the capabilities of efficient online target speech extraction and efficient FE with prior information for robust ASR. In addition, noise spectral features computed from DCICA are included for further improvement. Therefore, the DNN is trained to reconstruct a clean spectral feature vector, from a sequence of corrupted input feature vectors in addition to the corresponding preenhanced and noise feature vectors.

However, two problems can cause distortions in the conventional nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)-based SE algorithms. One is related to the overlap-and-add operation used in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT)-based signal reconstruction, and the other is concerned with directly using the phase of the noisy speech as that of the enhanced speech in signal reconstruction. These two problems can cause information loss or discontinuity when comparing the clean signal with the reconstructed signal. To solve these two problems, we propose a novel SE method that adopts discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT) and NMF. In brief, the DWPT is first applied to split a time-domain speech signal into a series of subband signals. Then, we exploit NMF to highlight the speech component for each subband.

For hidden semiMarkov models (HSMMs), the calculation can be approximated by keeping a track of the expected state duration instead of the distribution. The update equation for the expected duration proposed by Azimi et al.[1] is, however, wrong. The experiments presented by Azimi et al.[1] did not reveal the error, since for the presented cases, the state duration does not play a role in the probabilities. We propose a better equation for updating the expected duration. It nevertheless remains an approximation for calculating the probability of observation sequences. We analyze the assumptions to show under which conditions the approximation errors become important. Experiments show that the approximation is only reasonable for left-to-right HSMMs. As we focus on a specific sub class of HSMMs, we derive specialized equations from the general form for the exact calculation of the forward variable.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2583483","IWT Flanders(grant numbers:SBO 100031 POM2 - Prognostics for Optimal Maintena); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7497560","Forward procedure;hidden semi Markov models (HSMMs);semimarkov models","Mathematical model;Hidden Markov models;Uncertainty;Approximation error;Indexes;Informatics","","","","5","IEEE","22 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Highlighted in this letter, the existence of two convergence modes, linked to the negligible and to the significant taps, paves the way for the convergence analysis, which results in a set of nonlinear (quadratic) convergence equations. Therefrom, the minimization of the steady-state misalignment concludes in the optimal tradeoff, which happens to relate to the NLMS step size, filter length, plant sparsity, and noise level in an extremely compact fashion. Exhaustive simulation experiments show strong agreement between the analytical predictions and the empirical performance.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2587064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7503121","$\ell _0$ -norm;NLMS algorithm;sparsity tradeoff","Convergence;Algorithm design and analysis;Steady-state;Signal processing algorithms;Mathematical model;Approximation algorithms;Noise level","","6","","27","IEEE","1 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Its main limitation is due to the restriction on the moduli imposed by the CRT. To address the shortcoming, this letter proposes an application of the general Chinese remainder theorem (GCRT) to TTS, which provides a unified framework for TTS that is developed via the CRT. The proposed GCRT-based scheme not only employs integer sequences to form the moduli, but also repeats the moduli to enhance TTS via the CRT. To determine how to repeat moduli in a systematic way, this letter formulates an integer programming problem, which is solved by the branch-and-bound technique. Numerical results are presented, demonstrating that the proposed GCRT-based scheme outperforms earlier works with much shorter schedule lengths.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2581860","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST-104-2221-E-309-002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7493596","General Chinese remainder theorem (GCRT);topology-transparent scheduling (TTS)","Schedules;Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Instruction sets;Interference;Systematics;Protocols","","3","","20","IEEE","16 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The MM algorithm is proved to generate monotonically increasing sequences of likelihood values and to be convergent to a stationary point of the log-likelihood function. A distributed and parallel implementation of the MM algorithm is presented, and the MM algorithm is shown to have differing time complexity to the Newton algorithm.

Compared to centralized algorithms, they save much computation time and signaling overhead. We consider a two-hop network with multiantenna user pairs and multiantenna relays and propose two distributed algorithms to update the precoding, the decoding, and the relay amplify-and-forward matrices based on local channel state information. Both algorithms assume conferencing relays. One algorithm maximizes an approximation of the sum rate, where the convergence of the objective function is guaranteed. The other algorithm considers user pairs with limited computational capabilities, and relays take most calculations. The overhead and the distributed implementations are analyzed. Simulation results show that the two algorithms improve the existing distributed algorithm significantly in terms of the sum rate; both of them achieve at least one half of the sum rate by the centralized algorithm, but with much less complexity and lower overhead. The two algorithms provide diverse operating points for different types of networks, by well balancing the tradeoff among the achieved sum rate, the computational cost, and the feedback overhead.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2584099","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(grant numbers:801/13-1); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11401039,11331012,11471052); fundamental research funds for the central universities(grant numbers:BUPT2014RC0902); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7498616","Amplify-and-forward (AF);conferencing relays;distributed precoding and resource allocation;local channel state information (CSI);nonregenerative multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay network","Relays;Signal processing algorithms;Distributed algorithms;Receivers;Precoding;Decoding;Approximation algorithms","","1","","33","IEEE","23 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, two sorts of service messages are combined and served simultaneously: one multicast message intended for both receivers and one confidential message intended for only one receiver. The confidential message is kept perfectly secure from the unauthorized receiver. Our goal is to jointly design the input covariances for the multicast message and confidential message, such that the secrecy capacity region is maximized. This secrecy capacity region maximization (SCRM) problem is a nonconvex vector maximization problem. To deal with this issue, we reformulate the SCRM problem into a provably equivalent scalar optimization problem and propose a searching method to find its overall Pareto optimal points. Further, for implementation efficiency, transmit beamforming is proved to be Pareto optimal. However, since the two service messages are coupled in our optimization problem, it is difficult to deduce closed-form expressions of the Pareto optimal beamformers. A suboptimal transmit design is accordingly proposed to analytically obtain beamformers for both service messages. Numerical results illustrate that the performance gap between the Pareto optimal design and our proposal is negligible.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2586960","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571089); High-Tech Research and Development (863) Program of China(grant numbers:2015AA011309); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7506024","Broadcast channel (BC);physical-layer service integration (PHY-SI);secrecy capacity region;transmit beamforming","Receivers;Pareto optimization;Array signal processing;MISO;Closed-form solutions;Transmitters","","13","","12","IEEE","7 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
