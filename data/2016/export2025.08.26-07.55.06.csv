"An Amplitude Preserving S-Transform for Seismic Data Attenuation Compensation","B. Wang","State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting, China University of Petroleum, Beijing, China",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,"19 Jul 2016","2016","23","9","1155","1159","The S-transform (ST), as a time-frequency analysis tool, has been widely used, but the amplitude preserving property is a little poor near the boundary of the selected discrete signal. The reason lies that the summation of the product between the analytical window and the comprehensive window over the sliding step deviates from unity near the boundary in the discrete cases. In order to hold the amplitude preserving property for the discrete signal recovery analysis, an amplitude preserving S-transform (APST) is proposed based on a novel analytical window selection. First, lots of numerical tests are used to analyze the shortcomings of the ST near the boundary for the selected discrete signal and demonstrate the effectiveness and the validity of the proposed APST using the novel analytical window. After that, the proposed APST is used for seismic data attenuation compensation, during which the attenuation function is estimated based on the minimum phase assumption using a statistical variable-step hyperbolic smoothing method. Numerical examples on synthetic and field data demonstrate the validity of the proposed method using the seismogram and time-frequency spectrum comparisons. Besides, the proposed APST can be easily extended into a generalized ST which is more flexible compared with the ST, and it can also be used in seismology, remote sensing, and other related discrete signal analysis fields.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2586445","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1262207,41574113); National Science and Technology of Major Projects of China(grant numbers:2016ZX05024001-005); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2016M590102); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7501875","Amplitude preserving S-transform (APST);analytical window;attenuation compensation;time–frequency analysis","Attenuation;Time-frequency analysis;Estimation;Transforms;Mathematical model;Smoothing methods;Q-factor","","25","","19","IEEE","29 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This letter addresses the problem of joint optimization of energy-efficient beamforming and antenna selection for downlink multiuser systems. The nonconvexity arising from both the nonlinear fractional programming and the ℓ0-(quasi)norm presents the main difficulty in solving the joint optimization problem.

They are iterative in manner and often use a scaled value of the system noise energy as a reference threshold to decide when to stop the searching procedure. This letter presents an analytical analysis of the residual error and also of the difference of the successive residual errors in a general case of the greedy searching procedure, provided that the measurement error is an independent and identically distributed Gaussian stationary process. The obtained results show that the mean energy of the mentioned errors, just at the moment of perfect recovery of the signal support, depends only on the sparsity order and/or on the number of measurement samples. The results contributed to designing a practical stopping rule, which is a combination of those two errors. Numerical experiments with the new rule implemented in the OMP algorithm show that the number of executed iterations can be less spread around the true value of the signal sparsity in the mean sense. A quality of the sparse signal estimation is also preserved.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2588728","Ministry of Science and Higher Education(grant numbers:BK-220/RAu-3/2016); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7506326","Compressive sensing;greedy algorithms;orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP);residual error;stopping rule","Matching pursuit algorithms;Measurement errors;Sparse matrices;Measurement uncertainty;Estimation;Signal to noise ratio;Signal processing algorithms","","10","","12","IEEE","7 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Methods to track the sensor signal utility have been described for several multichannel signal estimation methods. For linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimation, the utility of a sensor signal is defined as the predicted increase in the minimum mean squared error when the sensor would be shut down. However, rather than making such a binary decision, more flexible energy-saving methods could be considered where a sensor changes internal parameters such as, e.g., the number of bits per sample, which results in noise injection in the transmitted sensor signal. We propose a generalization of the original definition of sensor signal utility to include this effect, and we show that it can be efficiently computed and tracked at hardly any computational cost compared to the already available LMMSE estimator. In addition, we illustrate how it can be used to assign a number of bits to each sensor with a greedy approach.

However, in the case of transmitting sparse frequency-stepped chirp signal (FSCS), the CS-based method will produce an irregular range cell migration (IRCM) problem in the recovered high-resolution range profiles (HRRPs). The IRCM is induced by the basis mismatch problem in CS, and it will degrade the ISAR image. To obviate the IRCM, an atomic norm minimization (ANM) method is proposed in this letter. By reformulating the ANM as a semidefinite program (SDP), the echo with full FSCS can be recovered using off-the-shelf SDP solvers. Thus, HRRPs without IRCM can be achieved via the conventional inverse fast Fourier transform. As a result, an improved ISAR image will be obtained.

These segmentation shortcomings adversely affect feature extraction and ultimately classification of swallowing function. In this paper, we propose a kernel density estimation-based algorithm to adaptively trim the swallow segments, and energy and noise-floor algorithms to reduce the number of false positive swallow segments.

This letter proposes an affine motion model for removing rolling shutter distortions. The model represents the image motion during image capture as a sequence of affine transformations and computes the composition of these affine transformations precisely. Because an affine transformation can be represented by a neural network with one layer of linear neurons, the motion model can be represented by a multilayer neural network of linear neurons. Thus, the backpropagation algorithm can be used to improve the efficiency of the optimization process that estimates the model parameters. The proposed model is calibration-free. It is more general than other rolling shutter motion models because it only assumes that the velocity of the image during image acquisition is piecewise constant. Experimental results demonstrate that the model is more accurate than two state-of-the-art models and that the model parameters can be estimated efficiently.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2591878","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51479158); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7514947","Affine transformation;CMOS image sensor;neural network;rolling shutter distortion","Computational modeling;Biological neural networks;Cameras;Distortion;Videos;Neurons;Optimization","","7","","20","IEEE","18 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Convolutional Edge Diffusion for Fast Contrast-guided Image Interpolation","W. Ye; K. -K.

However, its iterative edge diffusion (IED) process for diffusing continuous-valued directional variation (DV) fields inevitably incurs high computational complexity due to its iterative optimization process. The key objective of this letter lies in how to greatly reduce the computation of this diffusion process while maintaining CGI's superior performance on its interpolated image. The novelty of this letter started with a critical observation as follows. Since each diffused DV field needs to be thresholded for generating a binary contrast-guided decision map (CDM) in the subsequent step, such binarization operation will definitely destroy the fidelity that was preserved previously through the data term of the IED's energy functional. Therefore, the data term is lifted in our approach to yield a new energy functional. It turns out that the diffusion equation derived from this simplified functional is, in fact, the well-known heat equation, from which a highly attractive property of the heat equation can be exploited for conducting diffusion. That is, given a desired amount of diffusion to yield, it can be realized by simply convolving the DV field with a Gaussian kernel once, rather than gradually updating the DV field through iterations. Note that the variance of the Gaussian kernel corresponds to the amount of diffusion desired. As a result, the total computation time is significantly reduced. Extensive simulation results have shown that the proposed CED can generate nearly identical CDMs as those produced by the IED, while only requiring about 1/10 of its computation time. By replacing the IED with the proposed CED in the CGI framework, the total run time of our fast CGI is only 1/4 of the original CGI's on average.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2571738","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7476852","Contrast-guided decision map (CDM);contrast-guided image interpolation;convolution;edge diffusion;Gaussian filtering;heat equation","Interpolation;Image edge detection;Kernel;Mathematical model;Heating;Convolution;Diffusion processes","","13","","16","IEEE","23 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To overcome the problem, we propose low-complexity receivers based on two variational methods, i.e., mean field (MF) and Bethe approximations. Compared with the MF method, the Bethe approximation takes into account the conditional dependencies of pairwise symbols. By only considering a small set of the frequency-domain symbols that have strong interference to each other, the complexity of the proposed algorithms increases linearly with the block length.
