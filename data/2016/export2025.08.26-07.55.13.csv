We also propose the addition of an intermap pooling (IMP) layer to deep CNNs. In this layer, filters in each group extract common but spectrally variant features, then the layer pools the feature maps of each group. As a result, the proposed IMP CNN can achieve insensitivity to spectral variations characteristic of different speakers and utterances. The effectiveness of the IMP CNN architecture is demonstrated on several LVCSR tasks.

In particular, we propose to exploit the attribute dependency during the phase of attribute assignment, which can be regarded as our main contribution. In addition, to further enhance the performance, an effective low-level feature extraction mechanism is also proposed. More precisely, appearance and motion features are first simultaneously extracted from several sampled video frames and corresponding optical flow fields via deep convolutional neural network and then, respectively, aggregated by using Fisher vector encoding to form the low-level representation of crowded scenes.

Two approaches for DSR are i) signal-level combination using beamforming followed by automatic speech recognition (ACR), and ii) word hypothesis-level combination using several speech recognition engines followed by confusion network combination or followed by recognizer output voting error reduction (ROVER). In addition to these approaches, it is possible to examine training-level combination by training the recognizer on audio signals from multiple channels (microphones). In this paper, the authors investigate how these methods can be leveraged for in-vehicle ACR using the CU-Move corpus. The authors propose various combinations of these three methods to find an optimum structure for in-vehicle ACR. The authors also investigate the effect of speaker adaptation (SA).

In this letter, MF is used to handle the factor due to the nonlinear model, and a second-order Taylor approximation is used to achieve Gaussian approximation to the MF messages, which is crucial to the low-complexity implementation of the receiver with BP and EP.

Linear or nonlinear mapping on the intensity can be applied to the baseband signal to reduce the dynamic range before the signal is sent to the codec, and we refer to this range reduction step as a baseband quantization. We show analytically and verify using test sequences that the use of the baseband quantizer lowers the coding efficiency. Experiments show that as the baseband quantizer is strengthened by 1.6 bits, the drop of PSNR at a high bitrate is up to 1.60 dB.

The purpose of this letter is to propose a new optimization algorithm to address the issues. To keep the uniformity of the parameters for different PolSAR data, a sigmoid function-based normalization method is designed, which ensures the applicability of the WisTV model for the normalized data. By using the orthogonal decomposition of the PD variables, the WisTV model is converted into an unconstrained optimization problem which is further transformed into a multivariable problem based on the equivalent representations of the trace and logdet functions. The alternative minimization technique is then utilized to solve the final optimization problem. The subproblems for each individual variable are convex and their solutions have explicit expressions.

First, the eigenvalue spread of the autocorrelation matrix relevant to the hyperplane projection along affine subspace algorithm is approximately a square root of that for the kernel normalized least mean square algorithm. This clarifies the mechanism behind fast convergence due to the use of a Hilbertian metric.

This letter proposes a mathematical framework that optimizes the full-band signal power as a function of late reverberation power and the degree of signal nonstationarity. The prescribed signal gain is smoothed adaptively to suppress artifacts that may be introduced by rapid gain fluctuations due to frame-based processing. Compared to a reference method, it is shown that higher signal-to-late-reverberation ratio in nonstationary regions of the speech signal is achieved with less aggressive, on average, gain modification.

Thus, it is critical to explore all possible avenues to enable more orthogonal resources for the users to transmit noninterfering UL pilots. In conventional designs, pilot orthogonality typically assumes constant channel gains over time, which limits the amount of orthogonal resources in the case of time-selective channels. To circumvent this constraint, in this paper, we show how to enable orthogonal multiplexing of pilots in the case of Doppler fading by aligning the power spectrum densities (PSDs) of different users. From the derived PSD aligning rules, we can see multiple users can be sounded simultaneously without creating/suffering pilot contamination even when these users are experiencing time-varying channels. Furthermore, we provide analytical formulas characterizing the channel estimation mean square error performance. Computer simulations further confirm us the PSD alignment can serve as one important decontamination mechanism for the UL pilots in massive MIMO.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2601270","ShanghaiTech University(grant numbers:F-0203-14-008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7547312","Doppler;massive MIMO;pilot contamination;power spectrum density (PSD)","Contamination;Doppler effect;Channel estimation;MIMO;Interference;Multiplexing;Fading channels","","10","","24","IEEE","18 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, tracking methods relying on correlation filters are prone to drifting due to noisy updates. Moreover, these methods are unable to recover from tracking failures caused by temporary or persistent heavy occlusions. In this paper, we interpret correlation filters as the counterparts of convolution filters in deep neural networks. Correlation filters encode the holistic template of target appearance, while convolution filters with smaller size encode the part-based template. In the light of this idea, we propose to exploit deep convolutional networks that directly learn mapping as a spatial correlation between two consecutive frames for visual tracking. We show that these deeply learned networks are effective in maintaining the long-term memory of target appearance for handling heavy occlusion or out-of-view. We further take the response maps both from the deep networks and conventional correlation filters into account for precisely locating the target.

Compared with the conventional fast adaptive modulation, which requires fast-varying small-scale fading information, the proposed MAM scheme achieves similar ASE performance with slight increase in BEO.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2601932","National Key Basic Research Program of China(grant numbers:2012CB316104); National High-Tech.

Several ways to compute the importance weights assigned to each sample have been recently proposed, with the so-called deterministic mixture (DM) weights providing the best performance in terms of variance, at the expense of an increase in the computational cost. A recent work has shown that it is possible to achieve a tradeoff between variance reduction and computational effort by performing an a priori random clustering of the proposals (partial DM algorithm). In this paper, we propose a novel “heretical” MIS framework, where the clustering is performed a posteriori with the goal of reducing the variance of the importance sampling weights. This approach yields biased estimators with a potentially large reduction in variance. Numerical examples show that heretical MIS estimators can outperform, in terms of mean squared error, both the standard and the partial MIS estimators, achieving a performance close to that of DM with less computational cost.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2600678","Spanish government's(grant numbers:TEC2013-41718-R,TEC2015-64835-C3-3-R); BBVA Foundation's; ERC(grant numbers:239784); AoF(grant numbers:251170); NSF(grant numbers:CCF-0953316); EU's Marie Curie ITN MLPM2012(grant numbers:316861); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7544571","Biased estimation;deterministic mixture (DM);Monte Carlo methods;multiple importance sampling (MIS)","Proposals;Monte Carlo methods;Standards;Clustering algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Computational efficiency;Probability density function","","33","","16","IEEE","16 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Supervised Hashing Based on the Dimensions’ Value Cardinalities of Image Descriptors","D. Rafailidis","Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,"6 Sep 2016","2016","23","10","1479","1483","This letter presents a hashing method, in which the key idea is to exploit the discriminative power of image descriptors' dimensions' value cardinalities (DVC), that is, the number of distinct values that occur at the dimensions of the descriptors. DVC are an inherit characteristic of image descriptors, capable of boosting the search accuracy for approximate nearest neighbor search. However, previous DVC-based search strategies function in an unsupervised manner. To account for the fact that the semantic information of images can significantly leverage the search accuracy, this letter proposes an efficient supervised hashing strategy based on DVC. Given a set of training data, the proposed approach first calculates a consensus sparse matrix to consider both the DVC-based similarities and the sparse semantic information of images. Then, it formulates an objective function as a joint minimization problem, to jointly compute 1) the binary codes of the training data and 2) the projection matrix to map external queries to the Hamming space. The joint problem is solved via an efficient alternating optimization algorithm. Experiments on a benchmark dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over other state-of-the-art supervised hashing and DVC-based search strategies.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2599901","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7542552","Dimensions’ value cardinalities (DVC);supervised hashing;visual search","Sparse matrices;Semantics;Binary codes;Search problems;Minimization;Training;Training data","","2","","29","IEEE","12 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A noise-free ground-truth image may not be available, and different SNRs are simulated by injecting extra noise into an already noisy image. However, noise in real-world systems is typically signal dependent, with variance determined by the noise-free image. Thus, the noise to be injected shall also depend on the unknown ground-truth image. To circumvent this issue, we consider the additive injection of noise in variance-stabilized range, where no previous knowledge of the ground-truth signal is necessary. Specifically, we design a special noise-injection operator that prevents the errors on expectation and variance that would otherwise arise when standard variance-stabilizing transformations are used for this task. Thus, the proposed operator is suitable for accurately injecting signal-dependent noise, even to images acquired at very low counts.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2601689","Academy of Finland(grant numbers:252547); São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)(grant numbers:2013/18915-5); Brazilian Foundation for the Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)(grant numbers:88881.030443/2013-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7547951","Anscombe transformation;noise injection;optimization;Poisson noise;variance stabilization","Optimization;Standards;Signal to noise ratio;Noise measurement;Noise reduction;Image processing;Additives","","3","","21","IEEE","19 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
