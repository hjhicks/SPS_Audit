We quantify the effective channel coherence time in terms of the intertraining interval, which is the time after which the channel state information needs to be reestimated to avoid loss in performance due to outdated channel estimates. Conventional wisdom suggests that the coherence time of large MIMO systems should decrease with increasing number of antennas, because the system has a large number of independently varying channel coefficients. On the contrary, we show that the effective channel coherence time increases with the number of antennas. We optimize the throughput with respect to the symbol and pilot energies, the number of antennas, frame duration, and target SNR. This analysis brings out the important fact that the effective channel coherence time critically depends on the underlying signaling scheme, and not only on the temporal correlation coefficient of the wireless channel.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2604347","Department of Electronics and Information Technology Ministry of Communications and Information Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7556259","Beamforming;channel aging;massive MIMO;outage probability","MIMO;Throughput;Antennas;Channel estimation;Aging;Coherence;Signal to noise ratio","","34","","19","IEEE","30 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The confidential message is kept perfectly secure from the unauthorized receiver. DueAN54-B6010-A001 to the coupling of service messages, it is intractable to seek capacity-achieving transmit covariance matrices. Accordingly, we propose a suboptimal precoding scheme based on the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD). The GSVD produces several virtual orthogonal subchannels between the transmitter and the receivers. Subchannel allocation and power allocation between multicast message and confidential message are jointly optimized to maximize the secrecy rate in this letter, subject to the quality of multicast service constraints. Since this problem is inherently complex, a difference-of-concave algorithm, together with an exhaustive search, is exploited to handle the power allocation and subchannel allocation, respectively.

Third, two segments of the foreground are extracted from the two views by optimization of the graph via graph cut. Traditional methods generally define the priors and neighbor similarities in RGB space. Differently, the proposed method integrates disparity distributions of foreground/background to enrich the priors and defines the similarity metric between neighbor pixels in RGB-D space.

This has included validation of it for data collected from fixed costal surveillance radars, as well as airborne maritime surveillance radars. Consequently, there has been a steady development of radar detection schemes under such a clutter model assumption, both from a coherent and noncoherent detection perspective. One of the major initiatives at the Australian Defence Science and Technology Group has been to investigate the development of sliding window constant false alarm rate detectors for operation in a Pareto distributed clutter. A transformation approach has provided this capability, and one of the observations has been that a geometric mean detector, derived via this approach, tends to perform ideally when the number of clutter statistics in the clutter range profile is large.

Therefore, in this letter, we introduce a new beta-divergence-based variational model with total variation (beta-TV). The main advantage of the proposed beta-TV model is that it reveals a natural connection between the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation based nonconvex variational model and the I-divergence-based convex model without any special transform, such as log-transform or m th root transform. Through this relation, we show that beta-TV can be used as a convex-like relaxation of the MAP-based nonconvex variational model.

In this letter, we propose a novel adaptive fuzzy switching weighted mean filter to remove salt-and-pepper (SAP) noise. The process of denoising includes two stages: noise detection and noise elimination. In the first stage, pixels in a corrupted image are classified into two categories: original pixels and possible noise pixels. For the latter, we compute the maximum absolute luminance difference of processed pixels next to possible noise pixels to classify them into three categories: uncorrupted pixels, lightly corrupted pixels, and heavily corrupted pixels. In the second stage, under the assumption that pixels at a short distance tend to have similar values, the distance relevant weighted mean of the original pixels in the neighborhood of a noise pixel are computed. For a nonnoise pixel, retain it as unchanged; for a lightly corrupted pixel, replace it with the weighted average value of the weighted mean and its own value; and for a heavily corrupted pixel, change it to be the weighted mean. Experimental results show that compared to some state-of-the-art algorithms, our method keeps more texture details and is better at removing SAP noise and depressing artifacts.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2607785","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7563783","Fuzzy switching weighted mean filter;maximum absolute luminance difference (ALD);noise detection;noise elimination;salt-and-pepper (SAP) noise","Switches;Noise reduction;Signal processing algorithms;PSNR;Manganese;Information filters","","80","","17","IEEE","9 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

MELT is an iterative algorithm, and its each iterative step is a closed-form update, which can be implemented efficiently by fast Fourier transforms. As MELT is based on MM, it enjoys nice properties such as monotonicity and guaranteed convergence to a stationary point.

Recently, Mahler et al. have introduced a PHD smoother to gain more accurate estimates for both target states and number. However, as highlighted by Psiaki in the context of a backward-smoothing extended Kalman filter, with a nonlinear state evolution model the approximation error in the backward filtering requires careful consideration. Psiaki suggests that to minimize the aggregated least-squares error over a batch of data. We instead use the term retrodiction PHD filter to describe the backward filtering algorithm in recognition of the approximation error proposed in the original PHD smoother, and we propose an adaptive recursion step to improve the approximation accuracy. This step combines forward and backward processing through the measurement set and thereby mitigates the problems with the original PHD smoother when the target number changes significantly and the targets appear and disappear randomly. Simulation results show the improved performance of the proposed algorithm and its capability in handling a variable number of targets.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2611138","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/K014307); MOD University Defence Research Collaboration in Signal Processing; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7571163","Adaptive filter;multiple human tracking;probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter;retrodiction PHD (retro-PHD)","Target tracking;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Signal processing algorithms;Approximation algorithms;Radio frequency;Current measurement","","19","","22","CCBY","19 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In such models, the process of interest X is hidden and is to be estimated from an observable process Y . One common way to achieve the associated inference tasks is to define, on one hand, the prior distribution p(x); and on the other hand, the noise distribution p(y/x). While it is commonly established that the prior distribution is given by a Markov random field, the noise distribution is usually given through a set of Gaussian densities; one per each label. Hence, observed pixels belonging to the same class are assumed to be generated by the same Gaussian density. Such assumption turns out, however, to be too restrictive in some situations. For instance, due to light conditions, pixels belonging to a same label may present quite different visual aspects. In this letter, we overcome this drawback by considering an auxiliary field U in accordance with the triplet Markov field formalism.

Three parties are involved in the framework, including the content owner, the data-hider, and the recipient. The content owner encrypts the original image using a stream cipher algorithm and uploads a ciphertext to the server. The data-hider on the server divides the encrypted image into three channels and, respectively, embeds different amount of additional bits into each one to generate a marked encrypted image. On the recipient side, additional message can be extracted from the marked encrypted image, and the original image can be recovered without any errors. While most of the traditional methods use one criterion to recover the whole image, we propose to do the recovery by a progressive mechanism. Rate-distortion of the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art RDH-EI methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2585580","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61572308,U1536108,61525203,61472235,U1536109); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7501544","Encrypted image;information hiding;reversible data hiding (RDH)","Image segmentation;Servers;Encryption;Streaming media;Cloud computing;Data mining","","76","","15","IEEE","28 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it has been demonstrated that radio frequency impairments, such as amplifier nonlinearities, phase noise, and in-phase/quadrature-phase imbalances (IQI), can lead to a severe degradation in the performance and fairness. To this end, we study the power allocation (PA) problem in an orthogonal frequency-division multiple access system, when the served user equipment (UE) suffers from different levels of IQI. Additionally, we present a novel low-complexity solution with directly calculated PA policies, given the Lagrange multiplier, which mitigates the impact of IQI and achieves fairness in terms of capacity for the served UE, by maximizing the minimum achievable capacity of the UE. The effectiveness of the offered solution is validated through simulation results, which reveal that it can drastically increase the minimum achievable UE's capacity.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2614693","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7580621","Fairness;hardware-constrained communications;in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) imbalance;multicarrier communications;orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA);power allocation","Radio frequency;Baseband;Optimization;OFDM;Wireless communication;Resource management;Signal to noise ratio","","2","","25","IEEE","30 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Nonnegative Matrix Cofactorization for Weakly Supervised Image Parsing","G. Zhang; X.

In this letter, we propose a Nonnegative Matrix Cofactorization method to perform image parsing with noisy tags, i.e., some tags may be incorrect or missing. Given a collection of noisily tagged images, we first oversegment them into superpixels. Then, the superpixels' label matrix, which is aimed to estimate, and the feature matrix are simultaneously decomposed into nonnegative factor matrices with a graph Laplacian constraint and an orthogonal constraint. This cofactorization is able to jointly learn a discriminative dictionary and a linear classifier. The proposed approach therefore is robust to noise. Experimental results on two real-world image datasets MSRC-21 and LabelMe demonstrate the encouraging performance of our approach in comparison with the state of the arts.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2614704","State High-Tech Development Plan (863 Program) of China(grant numbers:2014AA09A510); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LY17F010007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7580651","Nonnegative matrix factorization;semantic segmentation;weakly supervised image parsing","Matrix decomposition;Semantics;Dictionaries;Sparse matrices;Noise measurement;Laplace equations;Image segmentation","","1","","27","IEEE","30 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
