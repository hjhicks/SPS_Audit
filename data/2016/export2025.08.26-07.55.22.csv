TOPS performs well at mid signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range, but fares poorly at high SNR and noise-free cases. The TOPS pseudospectrum often exhibits spurious peaks at all SNR levels. This paper attempts to explain the cause of poor performance, and proposes suitable modifications to extend the effectiveness of TOPS from low SNR to noise-free case. The proposed modified-TOPS (mTOPS) achieves reduction in spurious peaks by incorporating signal-subspace projection instead of null-space projection used in TOPS. It also uses trace as performance metric, instead of loss of rank used in TOPS. The effectiveness of mTOPS has been studied via simulations.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2614310","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7579190","Array signal processing;direction of arrival (DOA) estimation;DOA;high resolution;test of orthogonality of projected subspaces (TOPS);wideband sources","Direction-of-arrival estimation;Signal to noise ratio;Signal processing algorithms;Sensor arrays;Covariance matrices;Wideband;Estimation","","25","","13","IEEE","28 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose to model these AR coefficients using a first-order Markov process, whereas the reverberant microphone signal observations are considered deterministic. This leads to a framework where the AR coefficients can be optimally estimated using a Kalman filter per subband. As a consequence, we can dereverberate the observed signals by applying the estimated AR coefficients as an adaptive linear filter per subband. Estimators for the required statistical parameters in the Kalman filter are derived. Due to the adaptive solution, the algorithm is suitable for real-time applications. It is shown that the proposed method outperforms an existing recursive least-squares solution in terms of reverberation reduction, convergence time, and tracking changes in the acoustic scene.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2616888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7588997","Dereverberation;Kalman filter;Markov model;multichannel autoregressive (AR) model","Mars;Kalman filters;Computational modeling;Covariance matrices;Reverberation;Markov processes","","32","2","23","IEEE","12 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our DCCs take the form of homogeneous polynomials in cos λ and sin λ, where λ is the angular position of the CB projection. This trigonometric polynomial format for the DCCs is particularly convenient for medical imaging applications, and these new DCCs for the standard CB geometry will potentially lead to new DCC applications in X-ray computed tomography (CT) and pinhole single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) where CB projections are measured. If, as is usually the case, the object intersects the trajectory plane, then singularities appear in the DCC formulas.

However, generating a dense 3-D model is a computationally expensive process and reflection symmetry may not be evident in any of the 2-D views obtained through projections. In this letter, we propose an energy minimizationbased approach to detect the reflection symmetry present in the object from its multiple 2-D projections captured from different viewpoints and the sparse 3-D model obtained using these projections. The proposed approach only estimates the sparse 3-D model and utilizes content of the images in terms of local scale invariant features.

Secondly, we also derive the maximum average effective SINR of the strong user under the traditional maximum-likelihood (ML)-based estimator and linear minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE)-based estimator, respectively.

In long term evolution-advanced, the number of physical resource blocks (PRBs) are used to gauge the users' needs. Accordingly, there is a time in the network when it is beneficial to gain the advantages of consuming the unused PRBs in the transport block (TB) context to operate at a significantly lower power cost per PRB. The novelty of the letter is that the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) standard tables are used with multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) spatial multiplexing mode, to control the transport block size (TBS) index. This can be done by setting more PRBs and hence changing the modulation order that leads to reducing the transmitted power. In addition to that, MIMO layers, the prerequisite throughput, the intercell interference as well as the channel conditions of each user are considered as constraints to improve the downlink power efficiency. To describe the above-stated problem, an optimization problem is formulated as binary integer nonlinear program, which is very difficult to solve. Thus, a reformulation linearization technique based on a branch-and-bound framework is used to simplify the aforementioned BINLP.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2622479","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7723903","Long term evolution-advanced (LTE-A);multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO);spatial multiplexing (SM);transport block (TB)","MIMO;Downlink;Indexes;Multiplexing;3GPP;Optimization;Modulation","","4","","12","IEEE","27 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The nearly imperceptible artifacts pertaining to the extent and type of upscaling have not been predicted using natural scene statistics (NSS)-based models. We develop an accurate model for predicting the upscaling ratio applied to any natural image. By decomposing an input image frame using an orthogonal filter bank and locally normalizing the resulting responses, we show that the local energy terms can be used to predict the upscaling ratio.

The proposed framework naturally integrates self-paced learning regime into the manifold regularization framework for selecting labeled training samples in a theoretically sound manner, and utilizes locally linear reconstructions to control the smoothness of the classifier with respect to the manifold structure of data. Finally, the alternative search strategy is adopted for the proposed framework to obtain the classifier.

However, that eigenfilter may greatly attenuate widely spaced sources as SNR decreases, leading to severe performance degradation. Since the differential spectrum shows prominent spectral peaks around the true DOA angles even at very low SNR, we originally propose using it to derive two eigenvalue-based finite-impulse response spatial filters to overcome that problem. The first one employs the frequency sampling approach, whereas the second one includes moving average modeling, to fit the frequency response to the differential spectrum. Both the amount of spectral samples and the filter orders were carefully chosen to control aliasing in time domain and reduce the overall computational effort. The simulation results showed that the proposed filters preserved signal passbands of DOA sources, even where the maximum spatial eigenfilter failed. Compared with that filter, our propositions significantly reduced the threshold SNR for widely spaced sources while performing very similarly for closely spaced sources, at the expense of an small increase in runtime. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed filters are the first to allow spatial filtering in maximum likelihood DOA estimation independently of source separation.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2605006","Instituto Federal de Goiás(grant numbers:23380.000425/2014-09); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7557050","Array signal processing;direction-of-arrival estimation;maximum likelihood estimation;noise cancellation;spatial filters","Signal to noise ratio;Direction-of-arrival estimation;Maximum likelihood estimation;Degradation;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Covariance matrices","","10","","13","IEEE","31 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The quadrature Kalman filter (QKF) is the method of choice in many real-life Gaussian problems, but its computational complexity increases exponentially with the dimension of the state. As a promising solution to overcome the filter limitations in such scenarios, we further explore the multiple state-partitioning approach, which considers the partition of the original space into several subspaces, with the goal to apply a low-dimensional filter at each partition. In this contribution, the key idea is to take advantage of the estimation uncertainty provided by the QKF to improve the interaction among filters and avoid the point estimate approximation performed in the original Multiple QKF (MQKF). The new filter formulation, named Improved MQKF, considers Gauss–Hermite quadrature rules to propagate the subspaces of interest, together with cubature rules for marginalization purposes. The nested quadrature–cubature approximation provides robustness and improves the filter performance.

In the proposed algorithm, a noisy speech spectrogram can be decomposed into low-rank background noise components and an activation of the online speech dictionary, on which both low-rank and sparsity constraints are imposed. This decomposition takes the advantage of local estimated exemplar's high expressiveness on speech components and also accommodates nonstationary background noise. The local dictionary can be obtained through estimating the speech presence probability (SPP) by applying expectation-maximal algorithm, in which a generalized Gamma prior for speech magnitude spectrum is used. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using signal-to-distortion ratio, and perceptual evaluation of speech quality. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieves significant improvements at various SNRs when compared to four other speech enhancement algorithms, including improved Karhunen-Loeve transform approach, SPP-based MMSE, nonnegative matrix factorization-based robust principal component analysis (RPCA), and RPCA.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2627029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7740039","Low rank;online speech dictionary;sparsity;speech enhancement;speech presence probability (SPP)","Speech;Dictionaries;Signal processing algorithms;Matrix decomposition;Speech enhancement;Sparse matrices","","13","","18","IEEE","9 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At each time, the algorithm makes a new observation, produces a decision, and then adaptively updates all its parameters to enhance its performance. The algorithm mainly works in an unsupervised manner since in most real-life applications labeling the data is costly. Even so, whenever there is a feedback, the algorithm uses it for better adaptation. The algorithm has two stages. In the first stage, it constructs a score function similar to a probability density function to model the underlying nominal distribution (if there is one) or to fit to the observed data. In the second state, this score function is used to evaluate the newly observed data to provide the final decision. The decision is given after the well-known thresholding. We construct the score using a highly versatile and completely adaptive nested decision tree. Nested soft decision trees are used to partition the observation space in a hierarchical manner. We adaptively optimize every component of the tree, i.e., decision regions and probabilistic models at each node as well as the overall structure, based on the sequential performance. This extensive in-time adaptation provides strong modeling capabilities; however, it may cause overfitting. To mitigate the overfitting issues, we first use the intermediate nodes of the tree to produce several subtrees, which constitute all the models from coarser to full extend, and then adaptively combine them. By using a real-life dataset, we show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the state of the art.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2623773","Turkish Academy of Sciences Outstanding Researcher Programme; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7727946","Intrusion detection;semisupervised learning;statistical learning;tree data structures","Adaptation models;Decision trees;Tree data structures;Signal processing algorithms;Semisupervised learning;Intrusion detection;Statistical learning","","5","","31","IEEE","1 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To fully utilize the more accurate LOS measurements, we impose a weight to the term with respect to the NLOS measurements, and the choice of the weight is derived and explicitly given. We then employ the second-order cone relaxation technique to relax the problem as a tractable second-order cone program. Simulation results show that the prior path status information significantly improves the localization performance.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2627603","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571249); K.

The conventional Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based and deep neural networks (DNNs)-based BWE methods perform stably and effectively. However, the mapping function of GMM-based methods is a piecewise linear transformation, which is insufficient to model the complex nonlinear mapping relationship between the spectral envelope features of low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF). In the conventional DNNs methods, temporal correlations across speech frames are ignored, resulting in spectral detail loss of the reconstructed speech by BWE. To counter these issues, a multilayer DNN which is composed of two RTRBMs and a feedforward neural network (NN) is employed to obtain time information and model deep nonlinear relationships between the spectral envelope features of LF and HF. The proposed method takes advantage of the strong ability of RTRBM in discovering the temporal correlation in the high-order space and modeling deep nonlinear relationships between input and output. Both the objective and subjective evaluations indicate that our proposed method outperforms the conventional GMM-based methods and other NN-based methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2621053","China Scholarship Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7676312","Deep neural networks (DNNs);Gaussian mixture model (GMM);recurrent temporal restricted Boltzmann machines (RTRBMs);speech bandwidth extension (BWE)","Speech;Artificial neural networks;Bandwidth;Data models;Gaussian mixture model","","9","","27","IEEE","25 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, due to the patch-based manner applied in sparse coding, most existing SR-based fusion methods suffer from two drawbacks, namely, limited ability in detail preservation and high sensitivity to misregistration, while these two issues are of great concern in image fusion. In this letter, we introduce a recently emerged signal decomposition model known as convolutional sparse representation (CSR) into image fusion to address this problem, which is motivated by the observation that the CSR model can effectively overcome the above two drawbacks. We propose a CSR-based image fusion framework, in which each source image is decomposed into a base layer and a detail layer, for multifocus image fusion and multimodal image fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed fusion methods clearly outperform the SR-based methods in terms of both objective assessment and visual quality.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2618776","Qatar National Research Fund; Qatar Foundation; National Priorities Research Program(grant numbers:7-684-1-127); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7593316","Convolutional sparse representation (CSR);detail preservation;image fusion;shift invariance;sparse representation (SR)","Image fusion;Convolution;Transforms;Signal processing algorithms;Image sensors;Signal resolution","","816","","38","IEEE","19 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, a weak structural edge diminishing problem still exists because  $L_0$ penalty first removes small nonzero gradients. In order to address this problem, we propose superpixel-guided adaptive image smoothing by introducing an adaptive parameter into  $L_0$ smoothing framework. The adaptive smoothing parameter is efficiently computed in a cascade manner. In the first stage, we allocate smoothing parameters to the pixels consisting of details. More importantly, we then exploit similarities between a pixel and its surrounding superpixels for assigning smoothing parameters to the rest pixels. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method efficiently preserves structural edges regardless of their scales compared to previous methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2630741","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7748479","Adaptive image smoothing;edge-preserving image smoothing (EPIS);L_0 smoothing;superpixel","Smoothing methods;Image edge detection;Linear programming;Image segmentation;Robustness","","8","","16","IEEE","18 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
