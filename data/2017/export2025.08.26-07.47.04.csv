In this letter, a new algorithm is presented which constructs incoherent frames by minimizing the maximum absolute pairwise correlations (mutual coherence) of the frame vectors.

Most existing approaches utilize predefined LBP structures to extract LBP features. Recently, data-driven LBP structures have shown promising results. However, due to the limited number of training samples, data-driven structures may overfit the training samples, hence could not generalize well on the novel testing samples. To address this problem, we propose two structural regularization constraints for LBP-structure optimization: symmetry constraint and uniformity constraint. These two constraints are inspired by predefined LBP structures, which convey the human prior knowledge on designing LBP structures. The LBP-structure optimization is casted as a binary quadratic programming problem and solved efficiently via the branch-and-bound algorithm. The evaluation on two scene-classification datasets demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with both predefined LBP structures and unconstrained data-driven LBP structures.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2632167","Singapore Future Systems and Technology Directorate (FSTD)(grant numbers:MINDEF-NTU-DIRP/2014/01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7755825","Local binary pattern (LBP)-structure optimization;scene classification;structural regularization;symmetry constraint;uniformity constraint","Feature extraction;Training;Quadratic programming;Symmetric matrices;Linear programming;Pattern recognition","","6","","41","IEEE","23 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By using a probabilistic interpretation, this work presents a novel similarity measure between two complex random variables, which is defined as complex correntropy. A new recursive solution for the maximum complex correntropy criterion is introduced based on a fixed-point solution. This technique is applied to a system identification, and the results demonstrate prominent advantages when compared against three other algorithms: the complex least mean square, complex recursive least squares, and least absolute deviation. By the aforementioned probabilistic interpretation, correntropy can now be applied to solve several problems involving complex data in a more straightforward way.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2634534","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7763864","Complex-valued data;correntropy;fixed-point (FP) algorithm;maximum complex correntropy criterion (MCCC)","Kernel;Random variables;Mathematical model;Probabilistic logic;Signal processing algorithms;Cost function;Correlation","","60","","25","IEEE","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

More specifically, we propose to define the local patterns of the coherence along the dominant direction, the so-called local coherence patterns, as our features, which are fed into the linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier to determine whether a given fingerprint is fake or not.

However, many natural signals of interest, such as natural images, generally have sparse representations in known transforms. Hence, the performance of the signal reconstruction procedure can be improved by also taking into account this transform-domain sparsity of the signal. Thus, the TV minimization problem can be modified by introducing an $l_1$-norm penalty term. The $l_1$-regularized TV minimization problem searches for a signal with a sparse gradient and a sparse representation in the given transform. The main contribution of this paper is the derivation of a customized interior-point method for solving the $l_1$-regularized TV minimization problem that computes the search direction of the Newton method efficiently by exploiting the specific structure of the Hessian.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2636443","Academy of Finland and Infotech Oulu Doctoral Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7776847","Compressive sensing (CS);interior-point methods;  $l_1$  -regularization;total variation (TV) minimization","TV;Minimization;Transforms;Image reconstruction;Newton method;Noise measurement;Search problems","","2","","18","IEEE","7 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

How to reduce the feature gap between images from different modalities is a critical issue to develop a highly accurate face recognition algorithm. Recently, joint Bayesian (JB) has demonstrated superior performance on general face recognition compared to traditional discriminant analysis methods like subspace learning. However, the original JB treats the two input samples equally and does not take into account the modality difference between them and may be suboptimal to address the heterogeneous face recognition problem. In this work, we extend the original JB by modeling the gallery and probe images using two different Gaussian distributions to propose a heterogeneous joint Bayesian (HJB) formulation for cross-modality face recognition. The proposed HJB explicitly models the modality difference of image pairs and, therefore, is able to better discriminate the same/different face pairs accurately.

Our experiments revealed that the addition of this sparse term alone significantly outperforms GMM based Fisher Vector by almost 20% improvement on small sized datasets (15-Scene, Caltech-10) and up to 5% improvement on medium sized datasets (MIT-67). In the original work, sparse coding based Fisher vector requires an off-the-shelf Sparse Coding solver. From a statistical perspective, an off-the-shelf solver may appear as a black-box. A more elegant way is to use a probabilistic model to learn Sparse Coding. We propose a probabilistic model known as sparse coding based GMM. It differs from GMM by an additional sparse coefficient hidden variable. The prior model of the sparse term is assumed Gaussian distributed for tractability. Inference of the model is performed by iteratively computing a set of closed-form solution obtained via variational method. Experimental results on several well-cited datasets show that our probabilistic based solver obtained on-par learning performance to an off-the-shelf solver as far as sparse coding based Fisher vector is concerned.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2636900","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7776856","Fisher vector;Gaussian mixture model;sparse coding;variational inference","Encoding;Computational modeling;Probabilistic logic;Bayes methods;Training;Approximation algorithms;Convex functions","","4","","19","IEEE","7 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the generic quantization table design that is based on the characteristics of human visual system (HVS) cannot adapt to the variations of image content. In this letter, we propose a just-noticeable difference (JND) based quantization table derivation method for JPEG by optimizing the rate-distortion costs for all the frequency bands. To achieve better perceptual quality, the DCT domain JND-based distortion metric is utilized to model the stair distortion perceived by HVS. The rate-distortion cost for each band is derived by estimating the rate with the first-order entropy of quantized coefficients. Subsequently, the optimal quantization table is obtained by minimizing the total rate-distortion costs of all the bands. Extensive experimental results show that the quantization table generated by the proposed method achieves significant bit-rate savings compared with JPEG recommended quantization table and specifically developed quantization tables in terms of both objective and subjective evaluations.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2641456","Rapid-Rich Object Search (ROSE) Laboratory; Nanyang Technological University; National Research Foundation, Singapore; Interactive Digital Media Strategic Research Programme; Peking University; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2015CB351800); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7790871","Image compression;just-noticeable difference (JND);quantization table;rate-distortion","Quantization (signal);Distortion;Discrete cosine transforms;Transform coding;Rate-distortion;Image coding;Optimization","","54","","20","IEEE","19 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to prevent overestimation of the undesired reverberant component, possibly leading to severe distortions of the output, we propose to use a statistical model for late reverberation to limit the power of the MCLP-based estimate. The resulting constrained optimization problem is solved by using the alternating direction method of multipliers, resulting in two variants of the dereverberation algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed constraint increases the robustness with respect to parameter selection and improves the usability for dynamic scenarios in comparison to the unconstrained method.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2640939","Marie Curie ITN DREAMS(grant numbers:ITN-GA-2012-316969); Cluster of Excellence 1077 “Hearing4All.”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7784743","Adaptive filtering;constrained linear prediction;sparsity;speech dereverberation","Speech;Microphones;Optimization;Reverberation;Signal processing algorithms;Adaptation models;Indexes","","30","3","28","IEEE","15 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Trellis-coded quantization (TCQ) can reduce codebook size and codebook-searching complexity that are the main drawbacks of vector-quantization-based CSI feedback schemes. However, the beamforming gain of the conventional TCQ cannot be fully obtained in a spatially correlated channel that is inevitably involved in massive transmit arrays. In this letter, we propose a differential TCQ that exploits the channel correlation by using a compressive constellation and phase difference quantization. We present an algorithm for generating a phase difference constellation and a decoding process for the proposed differential TCQ. The proposed scheme can reduce the overhead of the codebook size problem by trellis decoding and improve the quantization performance at the same feedback rate compared to the conventional TCQ scheme.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2642223","Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.(grant numbers:IO130212-05665-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7792395","Limited feedback;massive MIMO system;spatial correlation;trellis-coded quantization (TCQ)","Quantization (signal);MIMO;Correlation;Array signal processing;Decoding;Downlink;Antennas","","3","","24","IEEE","20 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such estimates, together with the RSU's position information within beacon packets, are fed to a weighted least squares algorithm that aims at localizing the vehicle. The algorithm tries to take advantage of reliable measurements typically collected closer to the RSU-where a very high signal-to-noise ratio yields an accurate angular resolution-while keeping robustness against multipath phenomena.
