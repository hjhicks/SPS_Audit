Indeed, we show that the physical activity levels strongly correlate with changes in the wireless channel that can be captured by measuring the signal strength of the eavesdropped frames.

Some of the proposed countermeasures have achieved impressive results when evaluated on intratests, i.e., the system is trained and tested on the same database. Unfortunately, most of these techniques fail to generalize well to unseen attacks, e.g., when the system is trained on one database and then evaluated on another database. This is a major concern in biometric antispoofing research that is mostly overlooked. In this letter, we propose a novel solution based on describing the facial appearance by applying Fisher vector encoding on speeded-up robust features extracted from different color spaces. The evaluation of our countermeasure on three challenging benchmark face-spoofing databases, namely the CASIA face antispoofing database, the replay-attack database, and MSU mobile face spoof database, showed excellent and stable performance across all the three datasets. Most importantly, in interdatabase tests, our proposed approach outperforms the state of the art and yields very promising generalization capabilities, even when only limited training data are used.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2630740","Academy of Finland; Infotech Oulu; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7748511","Biometrics;face antispoofing;face recognition;presentation attacks","Face;Databases;Image color analysis;Feature extraction;Robustness;Encoding;Benchmark testing","","141","","29","IEEE","18 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, the target object can be well represented by a sparse set of target templates together with a sparse set of target weight maps. We propose a unified objective function to integrate these two sparse representation problems together. This optimization problem can be well solved by the proposed iteration manner and a customized accelerated proximal gradient method.

The proposed fusion-based variational image-dehazing (FVID) method is a spatially varying image enhancement process that first minimizes a previously proposed variational formulation that maximizes contrast and saturation on the hazy input. The iterates produced by this minimization are kept, and a second energy that shrinks faster intensity values of well-contrasted regions is minimized, allowing to generate a set of difference-of-saturation (DiffSat) maps by observing the shrinking rate. The iterates produced in the first minimization are then fused with these DiffSat maps to produce a haze-free version of the degraded input. The FVID method does not rely on a physical model from which to estimate a depth map, nor it needs a training stage on a database of human-labeled examples. Experimental results on a wide set of hazy images demonstrate that FVID better preserves the image structure on nearby regions that are less affected by fog, and it is successfully compared with other current methods in the task of removing haze degradation from faraway regions.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2643168","ERC(grant numbers:306337); FEDER(grant numbers:TIN2015-71537-P); ICREA; Spanish government(grant numbers:IJCI-2014-19516); Spanish government(grant numbers:MTM2013-40824-P); BCAM Severo Ochoa accreditation of excellence(grant numbers:SEV-2013-0323); Basque Government CRG(grant numbers:IT649-13); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7792620","Color correction;contrast enhancement;image dehazing;image fusion;variational image processing","Minimization;Degradation;Image color analysis;Atmospheric modeling;Visualization;Lighting;Indexes","","50","","31","IEEE","21 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent work on singing voice separation has shown that the low-rank representation and informed separation approaches are both able to improve separation quality. However, low-rank optimizations are computationally inefficient due to the use of singular value decompositions. Therefore, in this letter, we propose a new linear-time algorithm called informed group-sparse representation, and use it to separate the vocals from music using pitch annotations as side information. Experimental results on the iKala dataset confirm the efficacy of our approach, suggesting that the music accompaniment follows a group-sparse structure given a pretrained instrumental dictionary.

An alternative which has not been explored is 3-D integral imaging, aside from a recent preliminary study which shows that it can be an effective sensory modality with some advantages over the conventional monocular imaging. Since integral imaging has also been shown to be a powerful tool in other visual tasks (e.g., object reconstruction and recognition) under challenging conditions (e.g., low illumination, occlusions), and its passive long-range operation brings benefits over active close-range devices, a natural question is whether these advantages also hold for gesture recognition. Furthermore, occlusions are present in many real-world scenarios in gesture recognition, but it is an elusive problem which has scarcely been addressed. As far as we know, this letter analyzes for the first time the potential of integral imaging for gesture recognition under occlusions, by comparing it to monocular imaging and to RGB-D sensory data.

For good accuracy, graphic equalizers consisting of cascaded IIR filters have been of very high order. A previously proposed parallel graphic equalizer entailing twice as many second-order filter sections as there are bands can have a maximum approximation error of less than 1 dB, but its design is complicated. This letter proposes a cascade graphic equalizer having an accuracy comparable to the best parallel graphic equalizer, although only one second-order section is assigned per command gain. A key idea is to use band filters whose interaction with the two neighboring filters at their center frequency is exactly controlled. The filter gains are obtained using the least-squares method with one iteration step, which involves linear interpolation of the target gain vector, inversion of a square matrix, and a few matrix multiplications. The proposed method is compared with previous designs and is shown to be the most accurate one. The new graphic equalizer is widely useful for audio and music processing.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2645280","Nokia Technologies; Aalto University Project(grant numbers:410642); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7797451","Audio systems;equalizers (EQs);IIR filters","Gain;Graphics;Equalizers;Bandwidth;Prototypes;Approximation error","","18","","25","IEEE","26 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The relative entropy is considered as a security measure for the indistinguishability of the CS-based cryptosystem. By developing an upper bound on the entropy, the security analysis reveals that the presence of wireless channels and additive noise contributes to reducing the relative entropy of the cryptosystem. Consequently, the CS-based cryptosystem with circulant matrices can guarantee wireless security in terms of the indistinguishability, as long as the channel gains and the plaintext-to-noise power ratio of an adversary are kept to be low for a long keystream and a short ciphertext.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2647953","GIST Research Institute; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7807277","Circulant matrix;compressed encryption;indistinguishability;relative entropy;wireless security","Entropy;Communication system security;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Encryption","","14","","27","IEEE","5 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing signals, the blanking nonlinearity induces intercarrier interference, which must be removed in order to fully exploit the advantage of the blanking nonlinearity and to avoid performance degradation. For this purpose, interference cancellation techniques are attracting a considerable attention. Particularly, the nonlinear iterative ones show a good complexity-performance behavior. Nevertheless, one of the most important features of nonlinear iterative methods in the context of interference cancellation often remains disregarded: The stability. In this correspondence, we prove the asymptotical stability in the sense of Lyapunov of a nonlinear iterative interference cancellation technique for OFDM signals with blanking nonlinearity in impulsive noise channels. This is achieved by reformulating the considered technique as a multithreshold recurrent neural network and by taking advantage of the extensive research on the Lyapunov stability of recurrent neural networks. We show that the considered nonlinear iterative interference cancellation technique either reaches a fixed point or a limit cycle of length two. The obtained results can be utilized to find an upper bound on the required number of iterations to settle on a fixed point.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2650867","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7812622","Blanking nonlinearity (BN);Lyapunov functions;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM);recurrent neural networks (RNN)","OFDM;Asymptotic stability;Recurrent neural networks;Interference cancellation;Blanking;Stability analysis","","5","","24","IEEE","10 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed total variation denoising method can be implemented using forward-backward splitting.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2647948","NSF(grant numbers:1525398); ONR(grant numbers:N00014-15-1-2314); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7807310","Convex;denoising;sparse;total variation (TV)","Noise reduction;TV;Cost function;Convex functions;Standards;Signal processing algorithms;Estimation","","104","","53","IEEE","5 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, we construct a single manifold for all subjects across both azimuth and elevation angles through the construction of an intersubject graph (ISG) that includes important prior knowledge of the HRTFs such as correlations across individuals, directions, and ears. Then, for a new direction, we predict its corresponding low-dimensional HRTF by interpolating over same subject low-dimensional measured HRTFs. Finally, we use a local neighborhood mapping in the manifold to reconstruct the high-dimensional HRTF from measured HRTFs of all subjects. We show that a single manifold representation obtained through the ISG is a powerful way to allow measured HRTFs from different subjects to contribute for reconstructing the HRTFs for new directions. Moreover, our results suggest that a small number of spatial measurements capture most of acoustical properties of HRTFs. Finally, our approach outperforms other linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis, locally linear embedding, and Laplacian eigenmaps.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2648794","São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)(grant numbers:2012/50468-6,2013/21349-1,2014/14630-9); National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq)(grant numbers:308882/2013-0,454082/2014-2); CAPES; Unicamp's IRB(grant numbers:15641313.7.0000.5404); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7807250","Head-related transfer function (HRTF) interpolation;manifold learning;spatial audio;virtual auditory displays","Manifolds;Interpolation;Ear;Azimuth;Principal component analysis;Databases;Measurement","","20","","52","IEEE","5 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Particularly, we focus on the acoustic indoor localization that works in real environments, which have been seldom addressed in previous studies. In the actual environments, it is difficult to estimate the correct time delays for localization due to multipath signals caused by acoustic reverberation. The proposed algorithm minimizes the effect of multipaths and determines the target position based on a novel reliability measure. Experiments conducted in both actual room and simulated environments showed good performance of the proposed technique.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2642178","National Research Foundation of Korea; Korea government (MEST)(grant numbers:NRF-2015R1A2A1A15054343); MSIP; ITRC (Information Technology Research Center)(grant numbers:IITP-2016-H8501-16-1016); IITP (Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7792134","Acoustic indoor localization (AIL);time-delay estimation (TDE);time difference of arrival (TDOA);time of arrival (TOA)","Receivers;Reverberation;Delay effects;Signal processing algorithms;Estimation;Microphones","","27","","15","IEEE","20 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To recover latent signals when only noisy mixed measurements of the signal are available, we propose the Gaussian process mixture of measurements (GPMM), which models the latent signal as a Gaussian process (GP) and allows us to perform Bayesian inference on such signal conditional to a set of noisy mixture of measurements. We describe how to train GPMM, that is, to find the hyperparameters of the GP and the mixing weights, and how to perform inference on the latent signal under GPMM; additionally, we identify the solution to the underdetermined linear system resulting from a sensing application as a particular case of GPMM. The proposed model is validated in the recovery of three signals: A smooth synthetic signal, a real-world heart-rate time series and a step function, where GPMM outperformed the standard GP in terms of estimation error, uncertainty representation, and recovery of the spectral content of the latent signal.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2637312","CONICYT(grant numbers:PAI-82140061); Basal-CMM; FONDECYT(grant numbers:3130729); CONICYT-PCHA Doctorado Nacional(grant numbers:2016-21161789); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7776817","Bayesian inference;convolution process;Gaussian process (GP);sensing applications;underdetermined linear systems","Noise measurement;Weight measurement;Extraterrestrial measurements;Robot sensing systems;Linear systems;Gaussian processes","","4","","19","IEEE","7 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is a very difficult design problem with no available exact solution techniques. A path-following procedure, which iteratively improves its feasible points by using a simple quadratic program of moderate dimension, is proposed. Under any fixed computational tolerance, the procedure terminates after finitely many iterations, yielding at least a locally optimal solution.

For scalar parameter estimation, the proposed technique minimizes the worst case estimation error arising due to the channel uncertainties while ensuring the maximum gain at each receive antenna. For vector parameter estimation, since the general noisy measurement case is intractable, a robust precoder is developed for noiseless sensor measurements that eliminates the need for postprocessing at the fusion center while simultaneously minimizing the worst case estimation error. Simulation results show that the proposed techniques have a superior performance in comparison to imperfect CSI agnostic estimation techniques.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2647984","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7807319","Channel uncertainty;decentralized estimation;parameter estimation;robust precoding","Uncertainty;Channel estimation;Estimation;Precoding;Robustness;Parameter estimation;Wireless sensor networks","","20","","28","IEEE","5 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
