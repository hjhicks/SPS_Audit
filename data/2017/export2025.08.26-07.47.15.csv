"ML Estimation and Detection of Multiple Frequencies Through Periodogram Estimate Refinement","J. Selva","Department of Physics, Systems Engineering and Signal Theory, University of Alicante, Alicante, Spain",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,"31 Jan 2017","2017","24","3","249","253","This letter presents a method to detect and estimate multiple frequencies based on the maximum-likelihood principle. The method addresses the three main difficulties in this kind of computation, which are the detection of the number of frequencies, the coarse localization of the cost function's global maximum, and the iterative refinement of an initial estimate. Fundamentally, it consists of first detecting and estimating single frequencies or frequency clusters using the periodogram, and then refining this last estimate through a Newton-type method. This second step is fast because its complexity is independent of the number of samples, once a single fast Fourier transform (FFT) has been computed. These two steps are iteratively repeated until no mode frequency is above a fixed detection threshold. The main advantage of the proposed method is its low complexity, given that its computational burden is just that of a few FFTs in typical scenarios. The method is assessed in a numerical example.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2645283","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and EU FEDER(grant numbers:TIN2014-55413-C2-2-P); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7797511","Barycentric interpolation;iterative methods;maximum likelihood estimation;multiple frequency estimation","Frequency estimation;Maximum likelihood estimation;Complexity theory;Cost function;Interpolation;Iterative methods","","16","","14","IEEE","26 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This was demonstrated with an architecture consisting of an encoder and a decoder. The decoder is a mirrored version of the encoder, where convolutions are replaced with deconvolutions and poolings are replaced with unpooling layers. The locations of the max pool switches are transmitted to the corresponding unpooling layer. The reconstruction is computed only from these switches without the use of feature values. Using only the max switch location information of the pool layers, a surprisingly good image reconstruction can be achieved. We examine this effect in various architectures, as well as how the quality of the reconstruction is affected by the number of features. We also compare the reconstruction with an encoder with randomly initialized weights with an encoder pretrained for classification.

Second, we propose the use of audio data augmentation for overcoming the problem of data scarcity and explore the influence of different augmentations on the performance of the proposed CNN architecture. Combined with data augmentation, the proposed model produces state-of-the-art results for environmental sound classification. We show that the improved performance stems from the combination of a deep, high-capacity model and an augmented training set: this combination outperforms both the proposed CNN without augmentation and a “shallow” dictionary learning model with augmentation. Finally, we examine the influence of each augmentation on the model's classification accuracy for each class, and observe that the accuracy for each class is influenced differently by each augmentation, suggesting that the performance of the model could be improved further by applying class-conditional data augmentation.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2657381","NSF(grant numbers:1544753); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7829341","Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs);deep learning;environmental sound classification;urban sound dataset","Convolution;Training;Neural networks;Data models;Shape;Training data;Time-frequency analysis","","1154","3","32","IEEE","23 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Besides, age and gender introduce additional difficulties to the detection process. It is hard to determine whether a single pixel is skin or nonskin without considering the context. An efficient traditional hand-engineered skin color detection algorithm requires extensive work by domain experts. Recently, deep learning algorithms, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have achieved great success in pixel-wise labeling tasks. However, CNN-based architectures are not sufficient for modeling the relationship between pixels and their neighbors. In this letter, we integrate recurrent neural networks (RNNs) layers into the fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), and develop an end-to-end network for human skin detection. In particular, FCN layers capture generic local features, while RNN layers model the semantic contextual dependencies in images. Experimental results on the COMPAQ and ECU skin datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, where RNN layers enhance the discriminative power of skin detection in complex background situations.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2654803","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1449860,13505210); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61103056,61528204); China Scholarship Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7820144","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs);recurrent neural networks (RNNs);skin classification;skin detection;skin segmentation","Skin;Recurrent neural networks;Convolution;Image color analysis;Detection algorithms;Lighting","","101","","45","IEEE","17 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, we study the extension where a user's electricity load is input into a network of two rechargeable batteries, connected in series, and operating individually. This battery network attempts to mask the user load from the utility provider. We focus on the case of independent identically distributed load profile and a system of ideal batteries with no conversion loss, and use normalized mutual information (leakage rate) as the privacy metric. We derive upper and lower bounds on the leakage rate in terms of (single-letter) mutual information expressions. On the achievability side, our information-theoretic upper bound captures the novel tension between minimizing the leakage across each individual battery and the effect of their joint interaction. For the lower bound, we show that a system with a single battery, whose storage capacity is the sum of the two individual batteries, can achieve a leakage rate at least as small as our proposed setup. Furthermore, we use simulations to compare achievable leakage of our proposed scheme with several baseline schemes.

First, by using the local and neighboring property of the depth map, the background region is filled prior to the foreground region. Also, in the matching step to find the data to fill in, depth homogeneity is considered. Finally, based on the boundary decision using the depth property, the boundary regions are filled with background-relevant data to reduce boundary artifacts. Experimental results show that the views synthesized by the proposed method achieve higher visual comfort than the view synthesized by the existing methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2661319","Basic Science Research Program; National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning(grant numbers:2014011454); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7836315","Depth image based rendering;hole filling;image inpainting;view synthesis","Three-dimensional displays;Rendering (computer graphics);Cameras;Color;Electronic mail;Visualization;Filling","","17","","16","IEEE","30 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The paradigm of multiantenna zero-forcing beamforming is employed to null the interference at the primary users. A closed-form expression is derived for the probability density of successful packet transmission time followed by results for the average waiting and transmission times in an M/G/1 secondary user queuing system. Furthermore, this framework and the results are also extended to scenarios with ARQ and partial channel state information at the secondary transmitter. Numerical simulation results are presented to validate the theoretical performance analysis.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2659541","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7835142","Average transmission time;cognitive radio networks;M/G/1 queuing system;zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming","Interference;Queueing analysis;Cognitive radio;Array signal processing;Base stations;Receiving antennas","","4","","15","IEEE","26 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In our proposed algorithm, transmitted waveform covariance matrix has been optimized to focus the transmit beampattern into the target direction and in the receiver, we try to reject maximum number of interfering objects. In the proposed algorithm, transmitted waveform covariance matrix is able to be synthesized with binary phase shift keying waveforms in closed form. Simulation results show that our proposed method has better SINR performance in comparison with methods in which transmitted covariance matrix is designed independently from the interferences locations.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2663406","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839940","Covariance matrix;signal-dependent interference;colocated MIMO radar;waveform design;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)","Covariance matrices;Interference;Signal to noise ratio;MIMO radar;Optimized production technology;Antenna arrays","","30","","16","IEEE","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, reliable estimation of both the signal-of-interest and the self-interference channel, becomes the limiting factor in a mobile radio context. In this letter, improved estimation of the time-varying channels is obtained by solving the problem jointly with self-interference cancellation and decoding using a factor graph approach. Taking advantage of the per-subcarrier structure of message-passing, a low-complexity receiver is obtained. Our semianalytical and numerical results show the superiority of the proposed scheme over state-of-the art self-interference cancellation methods under limited pilot overhead.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2662799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7840034","Full-duplex (FD);joint channel estimation and decoding;message-passing receiver;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM);self-interference mitigation","OFDM;Receivers;Frequency-domain analysis;Estimation;Channel estimation;Decoding;Indexes","","7","","15","IEEE","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
