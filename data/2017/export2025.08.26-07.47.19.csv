"Joint Bayesian Estimation of Time-Varying LP Parameters and Excitation for Speech","S. R. Chetupalli; T. V.

Traditional approaches to TVLP estimation assume linear expansion of the coefficients in a set of known basis functions only. But, excitation signal is also time-varying, which affects the estimation of TVLP filter parameters. In this letter, we propose a Bayesian approach, to incorporate the nature of excitation signal and also adapt regularization of the filter parameters. Since the order of the system is not known a priori, we formulate a Gaussian prior for the filter parameters, and the excitation signal is modeled as Gaussian with time-varying Gamma distributed precision. We develop an iterative algorithm for the maximum-likelihood estimation of the posterior distribution of filter parameters and the time-varying precision of the excitation signal, along with the parameters of the prior distribution. We show that the proposed method adapts to different types of excitation signals in speech, and also the time-varying system with unknown model order. The spectral modeling performance for synthetic speech-like signals, quantified using the absolute spectral difference shows that the proposed method estimates the system function more accurately compared to several of the traditional methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2662481","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839300","Bayesian learning;linear prediction (LP);nonstationary signals;speech analysis","Speech;Bayes methods;Time-varying systems;Signal processing algorithms;Maximum likelihood estimation;Predictive models","","1","","17","IEEE","1 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As previously empirically verified, it is shown that the measurements have log-normal distribution even in idealistic environments, which cannot be explained using log-normal shadow fading arguments. Quantization and round-off errors induced by different measurement system components are also considered, and their impact are analyzed.

The modified coefficients, referred to as LNFB features, are a filter-bank version of locally normalized cepstral coefficients (LNCC), which have been described previously. The ability of the LNFB features is enhanced through the use of newly proposed dynamic versions of them, which are developed using an approach that differs somewhat from the traditional development of delta and delta-delta features. Further enhancements are obtained through the use of mean normalization and mean-variance normalization, which is evaluated both on a per-speaker and a per-utterance basis. The best performing feature combination (typically LNFB combined with LNFB delta and delta-delta features and mean-variance normalization) provides an average relative reduction in word error rate of 11.4% and 9.4%, respectively, compared to comparable features derived from Mel filter banks when clean and multinoise training are used for the Aurora-4 evaluation. The results presented here suggest that the proposed technique is more robust to channel mismatches between training and testing data than MFCC-derived features and is more effective in dealing with channel diversity.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2661699","CONICYT-FONDECYT(grant numbers:1151306); CONICYT-ANILLO(grant numbers:ACT 1120); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7837663","Automatic speech recognition (ASR);Aurora-4;channel mismatch;deep neural network (DNN);locally normalized filter bank (LNFB)","Training;Manganese;Filter banks;Testing;Robustness;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Histograms","","21","","26","IEEE","31 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This approach employs convolutional sparse coding along with lateral inhibition constraints to approximate a musical signal as the sum of piano note waveforms (dictionary elements) convolved with their temporal activations. The waveforms are pre-recorded for the specific piano to be transcribed in the specific environment. A dictionary containing multiple waveforms per pitch is generated by truncating a long waveform for each pitch to different lengths. During transcription, the dictionary elements are fixed and their temporal activations are estimated and postprocessed to obtain the pitch, onset, and note length estimation. A sparsity penalty promotes globally sparse activations of the dictionary elements, and a lateral inhibition term penalizes concurrent activations of different waveforms corresponding to the same pitch within a temporal neighborhood, to achieve note length estimation. Experiments on the MIDI aligned piano sounds dataset show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art music transcription method trained in the same context-dependent setting in transcription accuracy.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2666183","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7847380","Automatic music transcription (AMT);convolutional sparse coding (CSC);lateral inhibition;offset detection","Dictionaries;Convolution;Convolutional codes;Estimation;Encoding;Hidden Markov models;Multiple signal classification","","16","","39","IEEE","8 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study proposes a new LP technique, frequency-warped time-weighted linear prediction (WWLP), to provide spectral envelope estimates robust to harmonic peaks that work on a warped frequency scale that approximates the sensitivities of the human auditory system. Experiments are performed within the context of vocoding in statistical parametric speech synthesis. Subjective listening test results show that WWLP-based spectral envelope modeling increases quality over previously developed methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2665687","Academy of Finland(grant numbers:256961,284671); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7847373","Frequency warping;linear prediction (LP);source-filter model;speech synthesis","Speech;Predictive models;Time-frequency analysis;Frequency estimation;Harmonic analysis;Sensitivity;Speech coding","","3","","32","IEEE","8 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

SMM suppresses the time-variant noise, and remarkably improves the discriminability of features with historical signals. Compared with traditional MFCCs, the proposed method shows consistent performance improvements in experiments with measured data under different parameter settings. The effect of multiplication order of SMM on classification accuracy has also been discussed.

However, the clustering performance of affinity propagation is largely limited by the adopted similarity between any pair of images. As the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) has been widely employed to extract image features, the nonmetric similarity between any pair of images was proposed by “hard” matching of SIFT features (e.g., counting the number of matching SIFT features). In this letter, we notice, however, that the decision of hard matching of SIFT features is binary, which is not necessary for deriving similarities. Hence, we propose a novel measure of similarities by replacing hard matching with the so-called soft matching.

Widely applied in age-related tasks, the hidden factor analysis (HFA) model decomposes face feature into independent age and identity factors. However, the hypothesis that the identity and age factors are independent is not in accordance with the fact that aging has different appearance changes on different people's faces. To address this problem, this letter presents a novel method for cross-age face recognition, called age-identity modified HFA, which exploits a new latent factor modeled as a linear combination with the age factor and the identity factor. Hence, the cross-age identity information can be extracted and separated preferably. A maximum likelihood strategy is proposed to judge which gallery face has the same identity with the probe image, while we do not need to know what the probe identity is.

The method is based on the observation that the ability of a speaker to achieve an articulatory target, and hence clearly produce distinct phonemes, is related to the variation of the distribution of speech features that capture articulation-the larger the variation, the larger the number of distinct phonemes produced. In contrast to previous work, the proposed method is completely unsupervised, does not require phonetic segmentation or formant estimation, and can be estimated directly from continuous speech. We evaluate the performance of this measure with several experiments on two data sets: a database of English speakers with various neurological disorders and a database of Mandarin speakers with Parkinson's disease.

Taking videos as a sequence of frames, a new record was recently set on several benchmark datasets by feeding frame-level CNN sequence features to long short-term memory (LSTM) model for video activity recognition. This recurrent model-based visual recognition pipeline is a natural choice for perceptual problems with time-varying visual input or sequential outputs. However, the above-mentioned pipeline takes frame-level CNN sequence features as input for LSTM, which may fail to capture the rich motion information from adjacent frames or maybe multiple clips. Furthermore, an activity is conducted by a subject or multiple subjects. It is important to consider attention that allows for salient features, instead of mapping an entire frame into a static representation. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel pipeline, saliency-aware three-dimensional (3-D) CNN with LSTM, for video action recognition by integrating LSTM with salient-aware deep 3-D CNN features on videos shots. Specifically, we first apply saliency-aware methods to generate saliency-aware videos. Then, we design an end-to-end pipeline by integrating 3-D CNN with LSTM, followed by a time series pooling layer and a softmax layer to predict the activities. Noticeably, we set a new record on two benchmark datasets, i.e., UCF101 with 13 320 videos and HMDB-51 with 6766 videos.
