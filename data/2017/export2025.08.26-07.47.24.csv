In array signal processing, the manifold matrix can be described as the Kronecker product of two other matrices if the sensor array displays a separable geometry. This forms the basis of the Kronecker Array Transform (KAT), which was previously introduced to speed up the calculations of acoustic images with microphone arrays. If, however, the array has a quasi-separable geometry, e.g., an otherwise separable array with a missing sensor, then the KAT acceleration can no longer be applied. In this letter, we review the definition of the KAT and provide a much simpler derivation that relies on an explicit new relation developed between Kronecker and Khatri-Rao matrix products. Additionally, we extend the KAT to deal with quasi-separable arrays, alleviating the restriction on the need of perfectly separable arrays.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2674969","São Paulo Research Foundation(grant numbers:14/06066-6,14/04256-2); Brazilian Council for Scientific and Technological Development(grant numbers:306268/2014-0); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7864371","Fast acoustic imaging;Khatri–Rao identity;Kronecker array transform;microphone array","Transforms;Transmission line matrix methods;Sensor arrays;Microphones;Manifolds;Acoustic arrays;Acoustics","","7","","16","IEEE","24 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It takes into account the fact that the signal used for the activity estimation is sampled, and introduces another plug-in estimation to counterbalance the bias introduced by the sampling.

A two-layer Bayesian model is established, and a hyperparameter vector, which reveals the true DOAs, is set to control this common sparsity in the model.

A signal from an emitter reaching a group of sensors, each in a separate location, will have different arrival times. Finding the TDOAs between the output of pairs of sensors will provide the necessary measurements for the hyperbolic localization of the emitter. When the sensors acquire the signal by compressed sensing (CS), their outputs are reduced dimension linear transformation of the time samples of the signal. This shuffling of the time samples breaks up their time relation. Thus, a cross correlation of the CS output of two sensors cannot determine the TDOA. To apply cross correlation, it is necessary to reconstruct the time samples. This letter proposes an alternative that uses only the coefficients of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the CS samples. It begins with the derivation of the maximum likelihood (ML) equation and the ML estimator. This estimator requires known values of signal and noise powers. Substituting these values by their estimates lead to the approximate ML estimator. The phase of the product of two DFT coefficients from each sensor is proportional to the unknown TDOA. Hence, these coefficients can provide an estimation of the TDOA. Simulation results show that although ML is the best, as expected, all these estimators have very close performance.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2684185","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7880621","Compressed sensing (CS);discrete Fourier transform (DFT);maximum likelihood (ML);time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA)","Sensors;Discrete Fourier transforms;Maximum likelihood estimation;Compressed sensing;Mathematical model;Minimization","","37","","23","IEEE","17 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hence, those objects that are salient only in individual image or small portion of the image group should conceptually be treated as background. However, most state-of-the-art methods cannot do this well because they measure cosaliency as an explicit combination of single-image saliency and interimage similarity, thus inevitably leaving single saliency residuals into the cosaliency maps. In this letter, we show such problem can be solved by color feature reinforcement, based on a simple observation that cosalient objects usually have similar color distributions in an abundant color feature space. Since we model the cosaliency of an image w.r.t. another one as a reinforced product of the foreground dictionary and sparsely coded saliency coefficients of the two images, respectively, within a same rich feature space, we can effectively eliminate the single saliency residual effect in cosaliency detection. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of the proposed approach on benchmark datasets.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2681687","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671325,61572354); National Science and Technology Support Project(grant numbers:2014BAK07B03); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7876791","Color feature reinforcement;cosaliency detection;single saliency residual","Image color analysis;Feature extraction;Dictionaries;Image coding;Detectors;Fuses;Complexity theory","","26","","26","IEEE","13 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While in PEE with pixel sorting, the local complexity (LC), which is usually assumed to be proportional to the magnitude of prediction-error (PE), is exploited to reduce the embedding distortion. However, this assumption may not always hold in all conditions. In this letter, a directional enclosed predictor is proposed to detect the locations where LC is not proportional to PE. And, a directionally enclosed prediction and expansion (DEPE) scheme is then developed for efficient reversible data hiding. With DEPE, data embedding is restricted to pixels where LC correlates to PE with a proportional relationship.

Different from the existing schemes based on solving a minimization problem, we formulate matrix completion as a feasibility problem. An alternating projection algorithm (APA) is devised to find a feasible point in the intersection of the low-rank constraint set and fidelity constraint set. To achieve resistance to outliers, the fidelity constraint set is modeled as an ℓp-ball, where the ball center corresponds to the observed data.

Previous research works generally considered dimensionality reduction and radio fingerprint classification separately, which resulted in poor performance. The reason is that the feature set after dimensionality reductions may not be suitable for classifier. In this letter, a new radiometric identification method based on combined optimization of dimensionality reduction and fingerprint classification is presented. The proposed method attempts to find an optimal dimension-reducing projection matrix by minimizing the classification error and maximizing the quadratic mutual information between the reduced low-dimensional features and the class label simultaneously. Since both the uncertainty of the true class label of the reduced low-dimensional features and the classification error of the classifier are considered, the proposed method can obtain better results in radiometric identification applications. Experiments on real data sets demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms the other methods with a higher accuracy of radiometric identification, but also has a better robustness against noises. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can identify six emitters made by three different manufacturers with the classification accuracy over 95.08%.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2683523","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7879837","Dimensional reduction;linear regression classifier (LRC);quadratic mutual information (QMI);radio frequency (RF) fingerprint;radiometric identification","Radio frequency;Radiometry;Feature extraction;Optimization;Modulation;Gallium nitride;Mutual information","","6","","15","IEEE","16 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To tackle this problem, four high-order interpolants for four different directions are determined, and a weight based on the corresponding absolute directional color differences is assigned to each of them. In a smooth area, the interpolants in the four directions will have equal normalized weights of 1/4. In a nonsmooth area with a sharp edge, the normalized weights for the interpolants on the opposite side of an edge will be small and less than 1/4, but this inclusion will still manifest itself as color artifacts in the output image. In our proposed method, the frequency distribution of the weights for the entire image is first determined. To reduce color artifacts, the weights are hard thresholded such that any weights below a threshold are set to zero, and that optimal threshold is determined according to the frequency distribution of the directional color differences. A detail-preserving median based multishell filter is then applied to the fully demosaicked green channel to prune outliers resulting from high-order interpolation of thin features. Based on the experimental results, it has been shown that our proposed algorithm outperforms the other algorithms with minimal color artifacts for various types of images.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2658667","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7833147","Color filter array (CFA) color difference;demosaicking;frequency distribution;high-order interpolation (HOI);multishell filter","Image color analysis;Interpolation;Green products;Image edge detection;Color;Signal processing algorithms;Channel estimation","","8","","28","IEEE","25 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, we provide a novel sight to address this problem by interpreting JSR as a binary classification problem with respect to atoms. Meanwhile, MUSIC essentially constructs a supervised classifier based on the labeled MMVs so that its performance will heavily depend on the quality and quantity of these training samples. From this viewpoint, we develop a semisupervised MUSIC (SS-MUSIC) in the spirit of machine learning, which declares that the insufficient supervised information in the training samples can be compensated from those unlabeled atoms. Instead of constructing a classifier in a fully supervised manner, we iteratively refine a semisupervised classifier by exploiting the labeled MMVs and some reliable unlabeled atoms simultaneously. Through this way, the required conditions and iterations can be greatly relaxed and reduced. Numerical experimental results demonstrate that SS-MUSIC can achieve much better recovery performances than other MUSIC extended algorithms as well as some typical greedy algorithms for JSR in terms of iterations and recovery probability.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2680603","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671350,61173090,61072106,61271302); National Research Foundation for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China(grant numbers:20130203110009); National Basic Research Program (973 Program) of China(grant numbers:2013CB329402); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7875091","Greedy pursuit;joint sparse recovery;multiple measurement vectors;multiple signal classification (MUSIC);semisupervised classification","Multiple signal classification;Classification algorithms;Pattern classification;Computational efficiency;Atomic measurements;Iterative methods;Machine learning;Semisupervised learning","","20","","25","IEEE","9 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, for practical communications, the orthogonality between subcarriers may suffer from carrier frequency offset, resulting in intercarrier interference (ICI), which increases an irreducible error floor in proportion to the normalized Doppler frequency. The two-path transmission methods such as conjugate cancellation and phase rotated conjugate cancellation (PRCC) suppress ICI at the cost of reducing bandwidth efficiency. In this paper, a novel PRCC scheme with the method of separating the odd and even sequences of the transmission signals into two independent paths is studied and proposed to further mitigate the ICI over frequency-selective fading channels. Comparing with the conventional PRCC method, the proposed scheme can not only achieve higher data transmission efficiency, but also provide a better performance on bit error rate according to the final simulation results.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2686899","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601296,61671304,61601295); Shanghai Sailing Program(grant numbers:16YF1411000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7885561","Frequency-selective fading channel;intercarrier interference (ICI);orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM);phase rotated conjugate cancellation (PRCC)","OFDM;Frequency-selective fading channels;Data communication;Simulation;Receivers;Frequency division multiplexing","","11","","10","IEEE","23 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Depth information plays an important role in the human vision system while it is underutilized in most existing two-dimensional (2-D) saliency detection methods. In this letter, a multistage salient object detection framework via minimum barrier distance transform and saliency fusion based on multilayer cellular automata (MCA) is proposed. First, we independently generate the 3-D spatial prior, depth bias, and RGB-produced and depth-induced saliency maps. Next, the two saliency maps are weighted by depth bias to obtain two initial maps. Then, we adopt a saliency optimization step to generate more precise depth-induced saliency map. Moreover, the initial RGB-produced and the optimized depth-induced maps are further fused with 3-D spatial prior. Finally, we utilize MCA to fuse all saliency maps generated previously and obtain the final saliency result with complete salient object.

For example, a higher order subspace algorithm (HOSA) was proposed for the reduction of spatially white noise (i.e., the noise added to different sensors is mutually uncorrelated) and yielded an excellent performance. Nevertheless, for spatially colored noise (i.e., the noise added to different sensors is correlated or even perfectly coherent), HOSA suffers from serious performance degradation because the T-weighted noise covariance matrix is not strictly diagonal any more. In this letter, we present three efficient supplementations to HOSA to improve its performance on spatially colored noise. First, we directly estimate the weighted signal covariance matrices by speech subtraction because noise statistics are unknown and have to be estimated in the case. Second, we clear all the off-diagonal elements of the whitened T-weighted noise covariance matrix as they generally have negligible absolute values. Third, we process speech frames in an overlap-free manner to better meet the white noise assumption. In both simulations and real experiments, these supplementations can greatly improve the performance of HOSA on spatially colored noise while not affecting its performance on spatially white noise.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2680451","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671418); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7875153","A higher order subspace algorithm (HOSA);signal/noise covariance matrix;spatially white/colored noise","Speech;Tensile stress;Covariance matrices;Speech processing;Noise measurement;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Colored noise","","8","","29","IEEE","9 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, the input data are divided into different clusters and the number of clusters depends on the number of action categories. Within each cluster, we seek data items of each action category. If the number of data items exceeds threshold in any action category, these items are labeled as coherent. In a similar way, all coherent data items from different clusters form a coherent group of each action category, and data that are not part of the coherent group belong to noncoherent group of each action category. These coherent and noncoherent groups are learned using K-singular value decomposition dictionary learning. Since the coherent group has more similarity among data, only few atoms need to be learned. In the noncoherent group, there is a high variability among the data items. So, we propose an orthogonal-projection-based selection to get optimal dictionary in order to retain maximum variance in the data. Finally, the obtained dictionary atoms of both groups in each action category are combined and then updated using the limited Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno optimization algorithm. The experiments are conducted on challenging datasets HMDB51 and UCF50 with action bank features and achieve comparable result using this state-of-the-art feature.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2690461","Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7891563","Coherency;dictionary learning;sparse coding","Dictionaries;Sparse matrices;Matching pursuit algorithms;Coherence;Optimization;Signal processing algorithms;Encoding","","39","","22","IEEE","3 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two maximum-likelihood problems are studied: one for estimating the Toeplitz-structured coarray covariance matrix from the measurements, and the other for estimating the DOAs directly from the measurements. We establish the equivalence of both problems when the number of sources is assumed to be unknown and can potentially exceed the number of sensors. Additionally, it is shown that when the source waveforms satisfy certain orthogonality conditions, the Toeplitz-constrained maximum-likelihood covariance estimation framework provably produces the true DOAs without requiring to know the number of sources. When the number of sources exceeds the number of sensors, the maximum-likelihood algorithms studied in this letter outperform other recently studied methods, as demonstrated through numerical experiments.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2690601","NSF; CPS Synergy(grant numbers:1544798); University of California, San Diego; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7891579","Coarrays;maximum-likelihood direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation;nested and coprime arrays;nuclear norm minimization;superresolution","Maximum likelihood estimation;Direction-of-arrival estimation;Multiple signal classification;Covariance matrices;Sensor arrays","","40","","28","IEEE","3 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For preserving local structures of target template datasets, we present a novel structure-preserving sparse learning algorithm by obtaining sparse coefficients under maximum margin projection-based subspace representation and by updating the sparse codes under multiple task feature selection framework. To reinforce local structures of targets, we adopted a novel optimization process using an accelerated proximal gradient shrinkage operation and an efficient stopping criterion.

Most existing deep frameworks treat a video as an unordered frame sequence, and make a prediction by averaging the output of single RGB image, or stacked optical flow field. However, within a video, complex actions may consist of several atomic actions carried out in a sequential manner during its temporal range. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning framework, sequential segment networks (SSN), to model video-level temporal structures in videos. We get several short video snippets by a sparse temporal sampling strategy, and then concatenate the output of ConvNets learned from short snippets; finally, the concatenated consensus vector is fed into a fully connected layer to learn its temporal structure. The sparse sampling strategy and video-level structure enable an efficient and effective training process for SSNs. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that action recognition performance can be significantly improved by mining temporal structures, and our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2689921","National Nature Science Foundation(grant numbers:61171118); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7890436","Action recognition;representation learning;sequential segment networks (SSNs);temporal structure","Videos;Image segmentation;Optical imaging;Training;Network architecture;Histograms;Standards","","19","","34","IEEE","30 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While this may be the usual case for common audio signals such as speech, PHAT methods are affected negatively by modulation artifacts when the sources to be localized are passband signals. In these cases, steered response power PHAT localization becomes less robust. This letter analyzes the form of generalized cross-correlation functions with PHAT when passband acoustic signals are considered, proposing approaches for increasing the localization performance through the mitigation of these negative effects.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2690306","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(grant numbers:TEC2012-37945-C02-02,BIA2016-76957-C3-1-R); FEDER; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7891065","Acoustic source localization;generalized cross-correlation functions with phase transform (GCC-PHAT);passband signals;steered response power phase transform (SRP-PHAT)","Microphones;Meters;Acoustics;Signal representation;Bandwidth;Transforms;Speech","","13","","19","IEEE","31 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of many examples is ultrashort laser pulse characterization, in which the electromagnetic field is oscillating with ~1015 Hz and phase information cannot be measured directly due to limitations of the electronic sensors. Phase retrieval is ill-posed in most of the cases, as there are many different signals with the same Fourier transform magnitude. To overcome this fundamental ill-posedness, several measurement techniques are used in practice. One of the most popular methods for complete characterization of ultrashort laser pulses is the frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG). In FROG, the acquired data are the power spectrum of the product of the unknown pulse with its delayed replica. Therefore, the measured signal is a quartic function of the unknown pulse. A generalized version of FROG, where the delayed replica is replaced by a second unknown pulse, is called blind FROG. In this case, the measured signal is quadratic with respect to both pulses. In this letter, we introduce and formulate FROG-type techniques. We then show that almost all band-limited signals are determined uniquely, up to trivial ambiguities, by blind FROG measurements (and thus also by FROG), if in addition we have access to the signals power spectrum.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2690358","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program(grant numbers:646804-ERCCOG-BNYQ); Israel Science Foundation(grant numbers:335/14); Andrew and Erna Finci Viterbi Fellowship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7891012","Frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG);phase retrieval;quartic system of equations;ultrashort laser pulse measurements","Pulse measurements;Power measurement;Measurement by laser beam;Extraterrestrial measurements;Delays;Optical pulse generation;Phase measurement","","39","","34","IEEE","31 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
