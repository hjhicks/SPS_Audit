Compared to the original coordinates of the skeleton joints, the proposed features are translation, rotation, and scale invariant. To learn robust temporal information, instead of treating the features of all frames as a time series, we transform the features into images and feed them to the proposed deep learning network, which contains two parts: one to extract general features from the input images, while the other to generate a discriminative and compact representation for action recognition.

Performance bounds of parameter estimation for the coupled mixture model are established in terms of the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB). Unlike the pure PPS case, the derived CRB shows its dependence on the PPS-related and sinusoidal FM-related parameters due to the coupling mixture.

Its associated computational complexity grows significantly with the problem size, which hinders its application to many practical problems even with moderately large datasets. To address this issue, in this letter, we develop a fast inverse-free sparse Bayesian learning method. Specifically, by invoking a fundamental property for smooth functions, we obtain a relaxed evidence lower bound (relaxed-ELBO) that is computationally more amiable than the conventional ELBO used by sparse Bayesian learning. A variational expectation-maximization (EM) scheme is then employed to maximize the relaxed-ELBO, which leads to a computationally efficient inverse-free sparse Bayesian learning algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has a fast convergence rate and achieves lower reconstruction errors than other state-of-the-art fast sparse recovery methods in the presence of noise.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2692217","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61522104,U1530154,61201274); 111 Project(grant numbers:B17008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7894261","Compressed sensing;inverse-free sparse Bayesian learning (SBL);relaxed evidence lower bound (relaxed-ELBO)","Bayes methods;Compressed sensing;Signal processing algorithms;Matching pursuit algorithms;Covariance matrices;Sparse matrices;Computational complexity","","78","","16","IEEE","7 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A usual method consists in using the Newton-Raphson algorithm or its derivatives, either in floating or in fixed-point formats. With the former format, the standardized format of the mantissa makes the implementation easier, but for the fixed-point format there are many possibilities. This forces a design with scaling of the input in order to respect a predetermined work range. Having the input in a known range makes it possible to compute a first approximation with coefficients stored in memory blocks. With this method, it is hard to propose a “ready to use” IP for all the fixed-point formats. In this letter, a novel architecture, which does not require scaling, is proposed. This design is totally pipelined, ROM-less and can be directly used in any architecture.

In this letter, we propose a simple and computationally inexpensive method for alleviating this problem using planar microphone arrays. Given two identical reference beams pointing in two different directions, we show how to build a beam of nearly constant shape, which can be continuously steered between such two directions. The proposed method, unlike the diffused steering approaches based on linear combinations of eigenbeams (spherical harmonics), is applicable to planar arrays also if we deal with beams characterized by high-order polar patterns. Using the coefficients of the Fourier series of the polar patterns, we also show how to find a tradeoff between shape invariance of the steered beam, and maximum angular displacement between the two reference beams. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method through the analysis of models based on first-, second-, and third-order differential microphones.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2695082","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7903573","Beam steering;differential microphone arrays","Three-dimensional displays;Shape;Microphone arrays;Structural beams;Acoustic beams;Array signal processing","","38","","36","IEEE","18 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, we first illustrate that these nonunique artifacts, in addition to periodic signals, also contain random signals caused by the imperfection of SPN extraction method. To improve the quality of SPN and the performance of SCI, then we propose a scheme to suppress these random signals by decorrelation.

The Gerchberg–Saxton algorithm has been a workhorse in this area for many years. The algorithm extracts phase information from intensities captured in two planes related by a Fourier transform. The ability to capture the two intensities in domains other than the image and Fourier plains adds flexibility; various authors have extended the algorithm to extract phase from intensities captured in two planes related by other optical transforms, e.g., by free space propagation or a fractional Fourier transform. These generalizations are relatively simple once a unitary discrete transform is available to propagate back and forth between the two measurement planes. In the absence of such a unitary transform, errors accumulate quickly as the algorithm propagates back and forth between the two planes. Unitary transforms are available for many separable systems, but there has been limited work reported on nonseparable systems other than the gyrator transform. In this letter, we simulate a nonseparable system in a unitary way by choosing an advantageous sampling rate related to the system parameters. We demonstrate a simulation of phase retrieval from intensities in the image domain and a second domain related to the image domain by a nonseparable linear canonical transform. This work may permit the use of nonseparable systems in many design problems.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2684829","Science Foundation Ireland; Irish Research Council and Enterprise Ireland; National Development Plan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7882701","Fourier optics and signal processing;image reconstruction techniques;linear canonical transforms (LCT);phase retrieval","Signal processing algorithms;Fourier transforms;Optical imaging;Optical signal processing;Interpolation;Adaptive optics","","24","","34","IEEE","20 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although a lot of significant progresses have been made, most LBP variants still have limitations of noise sensitivity, high dimensionality, and computational inefficiency. In view of this, we propose a new noise-robust local image descriptor named the diamond sampling structure-based local adaptive binary pattern (DLABP) in this letter, which aims at achieving both efficiency and simplicity at the same time. It mainly features three contributions: 1) an effective diamond sampling structure to decrease the feature dimensionality significantly by fixing the number of sampling neighbors to a constant of 8; 2) a simple and new “average method on the radial direction” to enhance the noise robustness; and 3) an effective adaptive quantization threshold strategy to restore the noise-corrupted nonuniform patterns back to possible uniform patterns. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark texture databases of Outex, UIUC, and CUReT. Compared to state-of-the-art LBP-like methods, the proposed approach consistently demonstrates superior performances both in noise-free conditions and in the presence of high levels of noise, while it has a low complexity and a smaller feature dimension.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2694460","Open Research Fund of Key Laboratory of Spectral Imaging Technology(grant numbers:LSIT201606D); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Open Project Program of the State Key Lab of Novel Software Technology(grant numbers:KFKT2016B14); Nanjing University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7902119","Diamond sampling structure;local adaptive threshold;local binary pattern (LBP);low complexity;texture classification","Diamond;Quantization (signal);Feature extraction;Databases;Complexity theory;Noise robustness;Robustness","","26","","16","IEEE","17 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, we also propose a probe-specific reranking (PSR) algorithm to refine the initial ranking list measured by the learned metric.

In particle filtering, the posterior distribution of the state is approximated by a discrete mass of samples, called particles, that stochastically evolve in time according to the dynamics of the model and the observations. Particle filters have been shown to converge almost surely toward the optimal filter as the number of particles increases. However, when additional constraints are imposed, such that every particle must satisfy these constraints, the optimality properties and error bounds of the constrained particle filter remain unexplored. This letter derives performance limits and error bounds of the constrained particle filter. We show that the estimation error is bounded by the area of the state posterior density that does not include the constraining interval. In particular, the error is small if the target density is “well localized” in the constraining interval.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2696160","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CCF-1527822,ACI-1429467); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7906529","Constrained particle filter;convergence","Convergence;State-space methods;Estimation error;Electronic mail;Filtering;Probability density function;Kernel","","16","","26","IEEE","24 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, this equalization scheme cannot be directly applied to highly frequency selective channels without performance degradation. In this letter, we analyze the received signal after demodulation without any assumption on the channel selectivity. We develop a general closed-form expression for the equivalent channel seen at the demodulator. Furthermore, we design the associate channel equalizer. Simulation results demonstrate that the developed equalizer performs as equally with the previous PSC equalizer in the case of low frequency selectivity, and outperforms the PSC equalizer in highly frequency selective channels.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2697079","French National Research Agency (ANR) Project ACCENT5(grant numbers:ANR-14-CE28-0026-02); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7907209","Channel equalization;FFT-FBMC;filter-bank multicarrier;frequency selective channel","Equalizers;Demodulation;Indexes;OFDM;Frequency modulation;MIMO","","6","","9","IEEE","24 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"An Efficient Weighted Least Squares Estimator for Elliptic Localization in Distributed MIMO Radars","R. Amiri; F.

In this letter, an algebraic closed-form method for locating a single target from BR measurements using a distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar system is proposed. First, a set of linear equations is established by eliminating the nuisance parameters, and then, a weighted least squares estimator is employed to obtain the target position estimate. To refine the localization performance, the error in the initial solution is estimated in the sequence. The proposed method is shown analytically and corroborated by simulations to be an approximately unbiased estimation, which is able to reach the Cramer-Rao lower bound accuracy under mild noise conditions. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of this algorithm over the existing methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2697500","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7909034","Bistatic range (BR);multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar;target localization;weighted least squares (WLS)","Signal processing algorithms;MIMO radar;Mathematical model;MIMO;Estimation;Noise measurement;Receivers","","79","","15","IEEE","24 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, a contextual region containing both the object and its surroundings is explored to construct a compact representation with two bags-of-words. Each visual word is learned to carry discriminative appearance cues for the object. In order to alleviate the drifting problem, an adaptive updating approach is introduced to prevent the integration of the background into the object model. Based on DBoW model, a robust and near real-time tracker is proposed, where tracking is accomplished by searching the candidate that best matches to the maintained DBoW model. Extensive experimental results demonstrate competitive performance of the proposed method to state-of-the-art algorithms.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2698140","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61372118); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7912308","Adaptive appearance model;discriminative bag-of-words (DBoW);visual tracking","Adaptation models;Visualization;Robustness;Signal processing algorithms;Indexes;Deformable models;Computational modeling","","2","","27","IEEE","26 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since, in the literature, only forward differences have such a property, here, novel forms of backward differences and central differences based both on integer and half-integer mesh points are proposed. It enables the use of the proposed fractional differences interchangeably with standard difference formulas. The proposed schemes are qualitatively and quantitatively tested on 2-D signals for texture enhancement. The obtained results show that the proposed fractional differences provide better performances in comparison to traditional schemes.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2699285","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, Government of the Republic of Serbia(grant numbers:44009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7914616","Backward fractional differences;central fractional differences;fractional calculus;Grünwald–Letnikov derivatives;texture enhancement","Standards;Fourier transforms;Laplace equations;Mathematical model;Transfer functions;Image segmentation","","7","","21","IEEE","28 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, the corresponding optimal jamming beamformer and jamming power are presented. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed strategies attain better performance compared with intuitive benchmark schemes.
