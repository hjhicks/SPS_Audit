Lower limb human motion detection using sEMG signal is generally divided into gait subphase detection, locomotion mode recognition, and mode change detection. Existing feature extraction algorithms using sEMG signal have several innate problems in recognizing lower limb human motion detection. With respect to time-domain features, their values may be analogous because two different gait subphases and locomotion mode may have similar muscle activity pattern. Therefore, it is not easy to select the proper feature set of sEMG signals. The TAS feature extraction algorithm reflects better timing characteristics of sEMG signals than the existing time-domain feature extraction algorithm. Therefore, it can provide high accuracy in lower limb human motion detection. Experimental results show that the average detection accuracy values of the proposed method in terms of the gait subphase detection, locomotion mode recognition, and mode change detection are increased by 8%, 5%, and 4% better than those of feature values of the Willison amplitude, respectively.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2636320","Inha University Research Grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7776738","Electromyography (EMG);feature extraction;gait recognition;human–computer interaction;locomotion mode","Feature extraction;Muscles;Signal processing algorithms;Motion detection;Timing;Legged locomotion;Reactive power","","62","","18","IEEE","7 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Compressive Acquisition and Least-Squares Reconstruction of Correlated Signals","A. Ahmed","Information Technology University, Lahore, Pakistan",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,"9 May 2017","2017","24","7","933","937","This letter presents a framework for the compressive acquisition of correlated signals. We propose an implementable sampling architecture for the acquisition of ensembles of correlated (lying in an a priori unknown subspace) signals at a sub-Nyquist rate. The sampling architecture acquires structured compressive samples of the signals after preprocessing them with easy-toimplement components. Quantitatively, we show that an ensemble of M correlated signals each of which is bandlimited to W/2 and can be decomposed as the linear combination of R underlying signals can be acquired at roughly RW (assuming without loss of generality M <; W ) samples per second. In the case, when M ≫ R, this results in significant reduction in the sampling rate compared to MW samples per second dictated by the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem. The signal reconstruction is achieved by solving only a least-squares program, which is in stark contrast to the prohibitively computationally expensive semidefinite programming techniques suggested in the earlier literature. We also provide rigorous analytical results to support our claims.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2698071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7912294","Array processing;compressive sampling;correlated signals;micro-sensor arrays;randomized SVD;sub-Nyquist sampling","Coherence;Signal reconstruction;Fourier series;Standards;Frequency modulation;Computer architecture","","2","","19","IEEE","26 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using a parametric representation of finite-interval nonnegative polynomials, we obtain an optimization problem without external nonnegativity constraints, which can be solved using conventional quasi-Newton or nonlinear least-squares methods. The polynomial model guarantees smooth solutions and may realize a noise reduction. A dedicated orthogonal compression enables a significant reduction of the matrix dimensions, without sacrificing accuracy. The overall approach scales well to large matrices.

Time-varying analog signals captured from the sensors exhibit an almost periodic behavior due to repetitive nature of breathing activity. Sensor signals are transformed into two-dimensional point clouds with a technique that allows preserving the period information. Features, which represent the harmonic structures in the sensor signals, are detected by applying persistent homology and the RR is estimated based on the persistence barcode of the first Betti number.

For the special case of line spectral estimation, this upper bound on the dual atomic norm reduces to upper-bounding the magnitude response of a finite impulse response filter by a constant. It is well known that this can be rewritten as a semidefinite constraint, leading to an elegant semidefinite programming formulation of the atomic norm minimization problem. This result is a direct consequence of some classical results in system theory, well known for many decades. This is not detailed in the literature on atomic norms, quite understandably, because the emphasis therein is different. In fact, these connections can be found in the book by B. A. Dumitrescu, cited widely in the atomic norm literature. However, they are spread out among many different results and formulations.

The proposed estimator updates the frame size by considering two key parameters: One determines the limit of the slots occupancy at which the frame size should be increased, and the other one sets the frame size increase factor. A formal study is provided to adjust these parameters with the aim of lowering the estimation error while scaling to highly populated tag sets.

The method employs higher order antiderivatives of the nonlinear function used. The first-order form of the new method is equivalent to a technique proposed recently by Parker et al. Higher order extensions offer considerable improvement over the first antiderivative method, in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio.

Interpolation methods can reduce this limitation and make it possible to use the full coarray of partially augmentable arrays. In interpolation methods based on matrix completion techniques, we should complete an Nα × Nα Toeplitz matrix. For this purpose, a semidefinite programming (SDP) with O(Nα6) complexity should be solved. In this letter, we introduce a set that contains arrays that have the equal aperture with original array and have filled coarray. By selecting the array that have minimum number of sensors in this set, we formulate a new structured matrix completion problem.

This approach begins with the classical detectors, designed for operation in exponentially distributed intensity clutter, and adapts them for operation in any desired clutter environment. The approach preserves the original probability of false alarm and threshold multiplier relationship. A consequence of this approach is that the resultant detector often inherits clutter parameter dependence. As an example, in the Pareto clutter case, the modified decision rule is dependent on the Pareto scale parameter, while providing a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector with respect to the Pareto shape parameter. Recently, it has been shown that this dependence on the Pareto scale parameter can be eliminated by replacing it with a complete sufficient statistic, resulting in a new detector that achieves the full CFAR property. It will be shown that this result is due to the fact that the decision rule is based upon an invariant statistic. In particular, a general class of clutter models is identified, and it is shown that a generic transformed decision rule can be proposed, which is invariant with respect to a group of transformations, thus allowing the determination of sliding window CFAR detectors. This provides one with an effective means of producing such detectors for operation in many of the clutter environments of interest in radar signal processing.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2710344","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7937857","Constant false alarm rate (CFAR);invariance;radar detection;scale and power distributions;sliding window detector","Clutter;Detectors;Shape;Adaptation models;Radar signal processing;Random variables;Surveillance","","24","","37","Crown","1 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
