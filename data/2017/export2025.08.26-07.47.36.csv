This letter presents a new voice conversion method that needs no parallel speech corpus, and adopts a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) to represent the distribution of the spectral features derived from a target speaker. A linear transformation was employed to convert the spectral and delta features. A conversion function was obtained by maximizing the conditional probability density function with respect to the target RBM. A feasibility test was carried out on the OGI VOICES corpus.

"Primal-Dual Plug-and-Play Image Restoration","S. Ono","Laboratory for Institute of Innovative Research, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,"19 Jun 2017","2017","24","8","1108","1112","We propose a new plug-and-play image restoration method based on primal-dual splitting. Existing plug-and-play image restoration methods interpret any off-the-shelf Gaussian denoiser as one step of the so-called alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). This makes it possible to exploit the power of such a highly-customized Gaussian denoising method for general image restoration tasks in a plug-and-play fashion. However, the ADMM-based plug-and-play approach (ADMMPnP) has several limitations: 1) it often requires a problem-specific iterative method in solving a subproblem, which results in a computationally expensive inner loop; and 2) it is specialized to handle the formulation of a regularization (plug-and-play) term plus a data-fidelity term, so that it does not allow to impose hard constraints useful for image restoration. Our approach resolves these issues by leveraging the nature of primal-dual splitting, yielding a very flexible plug-and-play image restoration method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is much more efficient than ADMMPnP with an inner loop, whereas it keeps the same efficiency as ADMMPnP in the case where the subproblem of ADMMPnP can be solved efficiently.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2710233","JSPS(grant numbers:15H06197); JST-PRESTO; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7936537","Image restoration;plug-and-play approach;primal-dual splitting (PDS)","Image restoration;Noise reduction;Signal processing algorithms;Convex functions;Noise measurement;Iterative methods;Optimization","","128","","43","IEEE","31 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The choice of a sensing matrix that carries out the measurement has a defining impact on the system performance and it is often advocated to draw its elements randomly. It has been noted that in the presence of input (signal) noise, the application of the sensing matrix causes signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) degradation due to the noise folding effect. In fact, it might also result in the variations of the output SNR in compressive measurements over the support of the input signal, potentially resulting in unexpected nonuniform system performance. In this letter, we study the impact of a distribution from which the elements of a sensing matrix are drawn on the spread of the output SNR. We derive analytic expressions for several common types of sensing matrices and show that the SNR spread grows with the decrease of the number of measurements.

Most conventional feature extraction schemes (such as mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and perceptual linear processing coefficients) are based on short-time energy in each frequency band, and the temporal patterns of auditory-nerve activity are discarded. We compare the impact on speech recognition accuracy of several types of feature extraction schemes based on the putative synchrony of auditory-nerve activity, including feature extraction based on a modified version of the generalized synchrony detector proposed by Seneff, and a modified version of the averaged localized synchrony response proposed by Young and Sachs. It was found that the use of features based on auditory-nerve synchrony can indeed improve speech recognition accuracy in the presence of additive noise based on experiments using multiple standard speech databases. Recognition accuracy obtained using the synchrony-based features is further increased if some form of noise removal is applied to the signal before the synchrony measure is estimated. Signal processing for noise removal based on the noise suppression that is a part of PNCC feature extraction is more effective toward this end than conventional spectral subtraction.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2714192","Airbus Defense and Space Grant; Spanish Government-CICYT Project(grant numbers:TEC2014-53390-P); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7945498","Auditory modeling;auditory synchrony;feature extraction;physiological modeling;robust speech recognition","Feature extraction;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Speech recognition;Speech;Robustness;Frequency synchronization;Databases","","11","","25","IEEE","9 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The CRF potential of cells dynamically changes during the cell correspondence growing process, because the cells that have been matched already are not included in the calculation of the second-order potential. Therefore, the proposed CRF-based tracker tends to reduce tracking errors, while the previous local graph matching method tends to accumulate errors during the cell correspondence growing process. The CRF graph matching method greatly improves the tracking accuracy in noisy images and enhances the tracking stability because it always matches the most reliable cell pairs with the least CRF potential in the neighboring system.

Simulation findings are provided to highlight the appealing advantages of the new structure-based subspace method over the standard subspace method in certain adverse identification scenarios.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2715418","Deanship of Scientific Research at KFUPM(grant numbers:RG1414); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7948733","Blind system identification;subspace method;Toeplitz structure","Channel estimation;Cost function;Covariance matrices;Finite impulse response filters;Minimization;Linear systems;Standards","","22","","16","IEEE","14 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) has been commonly used for sparse representation of signals; nevertheless, due to its shift-variant nature, pseudo-Gibbs artifacts are present in the recovered signals. Using the redundant shift-invariant wavelet transform (SWT) is the ideal solution to obtain shift invariance; however, high redundancy factor of SWT limits its application in practical settings. We propose a dictionary splitting approach for sparse recovery from incomplete data, which leverages the ideas of cycle spinning in combination with Bregman splitting. The proposed method significantly improves the conventional signal reconstruction with DWT, offers the advantages of SWT, and overcomes high redundancy factor of SWT. We solve parallel sparse recovery problems with orthogonal dictionaries (DWT and its permuted versions), while we impose consistency between the results by updating the recovered image at each iteration. Our experiments demonstrate that few shifts are sufficient to achieve reconstruction accuracy as high as recovery with SWT, and significantly reduces its computational cost and redundancy factor.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2701815","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1617101); Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-14-1-0762); UFII graduate fellowship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7920408","Compressed sensing;cycle spinning;dictionary splitting;MRI;shift-invariant wavelet transform;sparse reconstruction","Discrete wavelet transforms;Spinning;Image reconstruction;Noise reduction;Signal to noise ratio;Redundancy","","4","","19","IEEE","5 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Considering this issue, we propose a convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based architecture that embraces multi-level and multi-scaled features. The architecture is trained in three steps. First, we conduct supervised feature learning to capture local audio features using a set of CNNs with different input sizes. Second, we extract audio features from each layer of the pretrained convolutional networks separately and aggregate them altogether giving a long audio clip. Finally, we put them into fully connected networks and make final predictions of the tags. Our experiments show that using the combination of multi-level and multi-scale features is highly effective in music auto-tagging and the proposed method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods on the MagnaTagATune dataset and the Million Song Dataset.

For instance, it is known that the HVS can only sense the content changes that are larger than the so-called just noticeable distortion (JND) threshold. Also, to reduce the computational load on the brain, the visual attention mechanism is deployed such that regions with higher visual saliency are processed with higher priority than other less-salient regions. It is also known that visual saliency has a modulatory effect on JND thresholds. In this letter, we present a novel pixel-wise JND estimation method that considers the interplay between visual saliency and JND thresholds. In the proposed method, the largest JND thresholds of a given image are found such that the perceptual distance between the image and its JND noise-contaminated version is minimized in a perceptual space defined by the coefficients of the image in a normalized Laplacian pyramid.

This work presents a generic and parameter-free transformation of binary iris representation into a rotation-invariant space. The goal is to perform accurate and efficient comparison and enable further indexing and template protection deployment.

Compared with the original RT, the ERT has shown more capacities, such as estimating the parameters of a strip in a plane. As the timeâ€“frequency representations (TFRs) of the hybrid LFM-SFM signal is a strip where there is a sinusoidal pattern embedded, the parameters of the signal are related to the strip; herein, we employ the ERT to estimate several parameters of the signal. With the estimated parameters values, the signal can be dechirped to be a SFM signal, whose parameters can be estimated by some existing methods.

Moreover, preserving the mean or median image brightness will sometimes produce a different result without a consistent preference. In this letter, we have developed a method to preserve either the mean or median image brightness by shifting the intersection point of S-shaped curves along the y = x line by successive approximation. To improve computational efficiency, two newly derived equations have been proposed to reduce the number of optimum control parameters from four to two for solving the S-shaped curves.
