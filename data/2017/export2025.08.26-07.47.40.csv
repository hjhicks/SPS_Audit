The underlying min-max problem is transformed into a weighted least squares problem, approximately solved with the shifted power method. The resulting algorithm is extremely simple, works directly with the frame and consists of almost only matrix-vector multiplications.

The total power is allocated for transmitting the radar waveforms and information signals in such a way that the probability of detection (PD) is maximized, while satisfying the information rate requirement of the CR. An exact closed-form expression for the probability of false alarm (PFA) is derived, whereas PD is approximated by assuming that the signal-to-noise ratio corresponding to the reference channel is often much larger than that corresponding to the surveillance channel.

Millimeter wave (mmWave) is a possible candidate for wireless power transfer, thanks to the use of directional antenna arrays. This letter presents a feasibility study of using mmWave for wireless power transfer in a large-scale network consisting of power beacons and energy harvesters. Using stochastic geometry, system performance is characterized while treating the network nodes as potential blockages to mmWave signals. A link-level metric (energy coverage probability) and a network-level metric (overall success probability) are considered. The former captures whether a typical energy transfer link provides the requisite energy, while the latter also takes the network load into account. Numerical simulations suggest that network densification helps improve the performance, despite an increase in the blockage density. For a given density, deploying an optimal fraction of nodes as power beacons maximizes the number of successful energy harvesters. Finally, mmWave outperforms lower frequency solutions despite blockages.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2715324","Army Research Office under Grant W911NF-14-1-0460 and a gift from Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7948803","Blockage;energy harvesting;millimeter wave (mmWave);stochastic geometry;wireless power transfer","Wireless power transfer;Antenna arrays;Measurement;Lead;Energy harvesting;Radio frequency;Probability density function","","19","","18","IEEE","14 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, the adjustment of measurement noise covariance is deemed paramount as it directly affects the estimation accuracy and plays the key role in applications such as sensor selection and sensor fusion. This letter proposes a novel adaptive scheme by approximating the measurement noise covariance distribution through finite samples, assuming the noise to be white with a normal distribution. Exploiting these samples in approximation of the system state a posteriori leads to a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), the components of which are acquired by Kalman filtering. The resultant GMM is then reduced to the closest normal distribution and also used to estimate the measurement noise covariance. Compared to previous adaptive techniques, the proposed method adapts faster to the unknown parameters and thus provides a higher performance in terms of estimation accuracy, which is confirmed by the simulation results.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2724848","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(grant numbers:PDF-487746-2016); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7972987","Adaptive Kalman filtering;covariance sampling (CS);gaussian mixture model (GMM);inverse wishart (IW) distribution","Noise measurement;Kalman filters;Covariance matrices;Gaussian distribution;Estimation;Adaptive systems;Q measurement","","54","","38","IEEE","11 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Further, if one of the sources is received with high signal-to-noise ratio, the mean of the Gaussian distribution is a function of location errors while the variance of the Gaussian distribution is invariant with location errors. We derive a closed-form analytical expression for the hybrid Cramer-Rao bound of the spatial frequency difference between two sources.

To reveal the unseen appearance variations implicitly in an image set, the prototypes are actually “virtual,” which do not certainly appear in the set but are searched in the corresponding affine hull. Moreover, to enhance the stability and robustness of the learned target subspace, an orthogonality constraint is imposed on the projection. Thus, to optimize the prototypes and the projection jointly, we design a specific gradient descent mechanism by updating the projection on Stiefel manifold and the prototypes in Euclidean space in an alternative optimization manner.

To alleviate these deficiencies, we introduce bidimensional distribution entropy (DistrEn2D). We evaluate DistrEn2D on both synthetic and real texture datasets. The results indicate that DistrEn2D can detect different amounts of white Gaussian and salt and pepper noise, and discriminate periodic from synthesized textures. The results also show that DistrEn2D distinguishes different kinds of textured surfaces. In addition, DistrEn2D , unlike SampEn2D, does not lead to undefined values. Moreover, DistrEn2D is noticeably faster than SampEn2D.

However, information from repetitive patterns is underutilized in computer vision algorithms as they cause burstiness issue in image similarity scoring. Existing similarity metrics do not take the repetitive patterns into account, and hence cannot handle images with repetitive patterns well. In view of this, this letter presents a new feature repetitiveness similarity (FRS) metric that not only addresses the burstiness issue, but also uses the information from the repetitive patterns to enhance the retrieval performance. The proposed FRS framework detects the repetitive patterns using descriptor and geometric information of local features in the images. Unique and repetitive features are handled separately and then fused at scoring stage using the FRS metric. Experiments conducted on the benchmark Oxford and Paris datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a mean average precision of 6%.

The autoregressive (AR) modeling approach, which preserves the high energy regions of the signal that are less susceptible to noise, first, presents a potential method for robust feature extraction. Second, there are strong correlations in the spectrotemporal domain of the speech signal, which are generally absent in noise. In this letter, we propose a novel method for speech feature extraction, which combines the advantages of AR approach and joint time-frequency processing using the multivariate AR modeling (MAR). Specifically, the subband discrete cosine transform coefficients obtained from multiple speech bands are used in the MAR framework to derive the Riesz temporal envelopes that provide features for ASR. We perform several speech recognition experiments in the Aurora-4 database with clean and multicondition training. In these experiments, the proposed features provide significant improvements over other noise robust feature extraction methods (relative improvements of 24% in clean training and 14% in multicondition training over mel features). Furthermore, the speech recognition experiments in REVERB challenge database illustrates the extension of the MAR modeling method for suppressing reverberant artifacts.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2724561","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7973047","Feature extraction;multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models;Riesz envelopes;speech recognition","Feature extraction;Speech;Spectrogram;Discrete cosine transforms;Noise measurement;Estimation;Speech recognition","","17","","22","IEEE","11 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Also, adaptive sampling can often provide accurate low rank approximations, yet may fall short of producing descriptive data sketches, especially when the cluster centers are linearly dependent. Motivated by that, this letter introduces a novel randomized column sampling tool dubbed spatial random sampling (SRS), in which data points are sampled based on their proximity to randomly sampled points on the unit sphere. The most compelling feature of SRS is that the corresponding probability of sampling from a given data cluster is proportional to the surface area the cluster occupies on the unit sphere, independently of the size of the cluster population. Although it is fully randomized, SRS is shown to provide descriptive and balanced data representations. The proposed idea addresses a pressing need in data science and holds potential to inspire many novel approaches for analysis of big data.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2723472","NSF(grant numbers:CCF-1552497); NSF(grant numbers:CCF-1320547); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7968311","Big data;clustering;column sampling;data sketching;random embedding;unit sphere","Signal processing algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Sociology;Statistics;Complexity theory;Approximation algorithms;Tools","","10","","50","IEEE","4 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To further improve the compression performance via filtering technique, we explore the factors that may hinder the potential performance of Wiener-based filters, and propose a near-optimal filter learning scheme for high-efficiency image coding. Based on the analyses, we observe that the foremost factor affecting the performance of Wiener-based filters is the divergence of statistical characteristics of training samples, instead of the filter taps or shapes. In view of this, we propose an iterative training method to derive the near-optimal Wiener filter parameters by simultaneously labeling sample categories at the pixel level. These parameters are compressed and transmitted to the decoder side to improve the quality of decoded images by reducing the coding artifacts.

It allows users to select viewing content freely in all directions. Assuming that viewing directions are uniformly distributed, the isotropic observation space can be regarded as a sphere. Omnidirectional video is commonly represented by different projection formats with one or multiple planes. To measure objective quality of omnidirectional video in observation space more accurately, a weighted-to-spherically-uniform quality evaluation method is proposed in this letter. The error of each pixel on projection planes is multiplied by a weight to ensure the equivalent spherical area in observation space, in which pixels with equal mapped spherical area have the same influence on distortion measurement. Our method makes the quality evaluation results more accurate and reliable since it avoids error propagation caused by the conversion from resampling representation space to observation space. As an example of such quality evaluation method, weighted-to-spherically-uniform peak signal-to-noise ratio is described and its performance is experimentally analyzed.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2720693","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61431015,61371162); National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program)(grant numbers:2015AA015903); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7961186","Objective quality evaluation;omnidirectional video;projection format","Distortion measurement;Extraterrestrial measurements;Distortion;Two dimensional displays;Weight measurement;Measurement uncertainty","","211","","12","IEEE","28 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
