The results show that the proposed model has a root mean squared error of 11.9%, compared to the previous model's 11.0%, while only taking 0.04% of the computational time of the previous model.

A standard result in this regard is that the least-square formulation of the registration problem admits a closed-form solution for two point sets. However, since the group of rigid transforms is not convex, solving the least-square optimization for multiple point sets is computationally challenging. It was recently demonstrated that the least-square formulation can be relaxed into a tractable semidefinite program, and that the relaxation is provably tight under certain assumptions. The difficulty is that standard solvers for semidefinite programming (e.g., interior-point solvers) cannot be scaled to handle large-sized problems. In this letter, we propose an iterative solver based on variable splitting and the alternating direction method of multipliers. Since each iteration essentially involves an eigendecomposition, the proposed solver can be scaled to problems that are beyond the reach of interior-point solvers. We present results on simulated and real data to demonstrate the potential of the solver.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2737518","NBHM Postdoctoral Fellowship from DAE, Government of India; IISc; EMR(grant numbers:SB/S3/EECE/281/2016); DST, Government of India; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8004486","Alternating direction method of multipliers;rigid registration;scalability;semidefinite programming","Standards;Transforms;Symmetric matrices;Convex functions;Manifolds;Noise measurement;Convergence","","7","","26","IEEE","8 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consequently, luminous intensity of a mains-powered light source varies depending on ENF fluctuations in the grid network. Variations in the luminance over time can be captured from video recordings and ENF can be estimated through content analysis of these recordings. In ENF-based video forensics, it is critical to check whether a given video file is appropriate for this type of analysis. That is, if ENF signal is not present in a given video, it would be useless to apply ENF-based forensic analysis. In this letter, an ENF signal presence detection method is introduced for videos. The proposed method is based on multiple ENF signal estimations from steady superpixels, i.e., pixels that are most likely uniform in color, brightness, and texture, and intra-class similarity of the estimated signals. Subsequently, consistency among these estimates is then used to determine the presence or absence of an ENF signal in a given video. The proposed technique can operate on video clips as short as 2 min and is independent of the camera sensor type, i.e., CCD or CMOS.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2741440","DARPA; Air Force Research Laboratory(grant numbers:FA8750-16-2-0173); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8012515","Electrical network frequency (ENF);ENF detection;multimedia forensics;superpixel;video forensics","Videos;Lighting;Light sources;Estimation;Forensics;Cameras;Time-frequency analysis","","38","1","21","IEEE","17 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There are two main approaches when the dictionary is composed of translates of an orthonormal basis. The first, traditionally employed by techniques such as wavelet cycle spinning, separately seeks sparsity w.r.t. each translate of the orthonormal basis, solving multiple partial optimizations and obtaining a collection of sparse approximations of the noise-free image, which are aggregated together to obtain a final estimate. The second approach, recently employed by convolutional sparse representations, instead seeks sparsity over the entire dictionary via a global optimization. It is tempting to view the former approach as providing a suboptimal solution of the latter. In this letter, we analyze whether global sparsity is a desirable property, and under what conditions the global optimization provides a better solution to the denoising problem. In particular, our experimental analysis shows that the two approaches attain comparable performance in case of natural images and global optimization outperforms the simpler aggregation of partial estimates only when the image admits an extremely sparse representation. We explain this phenomenon by separately studying the bias and variance of these solutions, and by noting that the variance of the global solution increases very rapidly as the original signal becomes less and less sparse.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2734119","Academy of Finland(grant numbers:252547); U.S. Department of Energy via the LANL/LDRD Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7997904","Convolutional sparse coding;denoising;overcomplete representations;sparse representations","Optimization;Noise reduction;Dictionaries;Convolution;Convolutional codes;Spinning;Encoding","","8","","19","IEEE","31 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, we propose a two-stream deep correlation network, which incorporates both geometric and textural features for frontal face recovery. Given a face image under an arbitrary pose as input, geometric and textural characteristics are first extracted from two separate streams. The extracted characteristics are then fused through the proposed multiplicative patch correlation layer.

As this latter bound is asymptotically achievable by the maximum likelihood estimator, while the DCRB is unattainable, it is important to have a compact closed-form expression for this SCRB to assess the performance of DOA estimation algorithms for rectilinear signals. The aim of this letter is to derive this expression directly from the Slepian-Bangs formula including in particular the case of prior knowledge of uncorrelated or coherent sources.

For the nonconvex optimization problem, we propose a rank-constrained separable semidefinite relaxation approach to find an approximate solution, and provide conditions for which it produces an optimal solution and a bound on the gap to the optimal performance. Compared with the traditional rank-one distributed relay beamforming scheme, our proposed Alamouti-based rank-two distributed relay beamforming offers a significantly higher likelihood to produce an optimal solution and a better capability to maintain small performance degradation as the network size increases.

We particularly discuss the problem of failure in the sensor/estimator network and how to recover for distributed estimation by adding new sensor measurements from equivalent states.

In this letter, we first propose an automatic steganographic distortion learning framework using a generative adversarial network, which is composed of a steganographic generative subnetwork and a steganalytic discriminative subnetwork. Via alternately training these two oppositional subnetworks, our proposed framework can automatically learn embedding change probabilities for every pixel in a given spatial cover image. The learnt embedding change probabilities can then be converted to embedding distortions, which can be adopted in the existing framework of minimal-distortion embedding. Under this framework, the distortion function is directly related to the undetectability against the oppositional evolving steganalyzer. Experimental results show that with adversarial learning, our proposed framework can effectively evolve from nearly naive random ±1 embedding at the beginning to much more advanced content-adaptive embedding which tries to embed secret bits in textural regions. The security performance is also steadily improved with increasing training iterations.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2745572","NSFC(grant numbers:61772349,U1636202,61572329); NSF of Guangdong province(grant numbers:2014A030313557); Shenzhen R&D Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20160328144421330); Faculty Startup Grant of Shenzhen University(grant numbers:2016052); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8017430","Embedding change probabilities;generative adversarial network (GAN);steganalysis;steganography","Generators;Distortion;Training;Convolution;Gallium nitride;Kernel;Security","","313","","30","IEEE","29 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The harvested power maximization problem is difficult to solve due mainly to the nonconcave objective and the nonlinear coupling of design variables in the constraints. To tackle these challenges, we first derive a good approximation of the problem by ignoring some negligible noise terms and then further simplify it to a more tractable form by well exploiting the problem structure.

The base matchers from low-level convolutional features have small receptive fields which contain partial details of targets while the base matchers from high-level convolutional features have big receptive fields which capture semantic information of targets. The model achieves the final strong matcher as a weighted ensemble of all the base matchers. We design an effective weights propagation strategy to update the weights of base matchers.

Usually, the contributions of each material are assumed to be perfectly represented by a single spectral signature and to add up in a linear way. However, the main two limitations of this model have been identified as nonlinear mixing phenomena and spectral variability, i.e., the intraclass variability of the materials. The former limitation has been addressed by designing nonlinear mixture models, whereas the second can be dealt with by using (usually linear) space varying models. The typical example is a linear mixing model where the sources can vary from one pixel to the other. In this letter, we show that a recent variability model can also estimate the abundances of nonlinear mixtures to some extent.
