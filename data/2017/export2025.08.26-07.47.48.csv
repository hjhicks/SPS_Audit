However, to be regarded a CNN resemblance, PCANet lacks a nonlinearity in between two successive convolutional layers. The multilayer PCANet (by neglecting the nonlinearity pre-requisite) is also deemed far-fetched for the network depth beyond two, due to feature dimensionality explosion. We thus devise a PCANet alternative, dubbed PCANet+ in this letter, to untangle these constraints. To be more precise, conforming to the CNN essentials, PCANet+ conveys a mean-pooling unit manipulating each feature map. On top of that, we streamline the PCANet topology to permit a deep construction with an expanded PCA filter ensemble. We scrutinize the PCANet+ performance using face recognition technology and other two faces in the wild datasets, namely, labeled faces in the wild and YouTube faces. The experimental results reveal that the PCANet+ descriptor prevails over its predecessor and other stacking-based descriptors in face identification and verification, serving a baseline for ConvNets.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2749763","National Research Foundation of Korea; Korea government (Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning)(grant numbers:2016R1A2B4011656); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8027103","Face recognition;principal component analysis (PCA) filters;PCA network (PCANet);stacking-based convolutional neural network (CNN)","Gabor filters;Principal component analysis;Face;Convolution;Feature extraction;Maximum likelihood detection;Nonlinear filters","","34","","31","IEEE","7 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, little work has been done to apply deep learning for face photo-sketch recognition despite its success in numerous application domains including traditional face recognition. This is primarily due to the limited number of sketch images available, which are insufficient to robustly train large networks. This letter aims to tackle these issues with the following contributions: 1) a state-of-the-art model pre-trained for face photo recognition is tuned for face photo-sketch recognition by applying transfer learning, 2) a three-dimensional morphable model is used to synthesise new images and artificially expand the training data, allowing the network to prevent over-fitting and learn better features, 3) multiple synthetic sketches are also used in the testing stage to improve performance, and 4) fusion of the proposed method with a state-of-the-art algorithm is shown to further boost performance. An extensive evaluation of several popular and state-of-the-art algorithms is also performed using publicly available datasets, thereby serving as a benchmark for future algorithms. Compared to a leading method, the proposed framework is shown to reduce the error rate by 80.7% for viewed sketches and lowers the mean retrieval rank by 32.5% for real-world forensic sketches.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2749266","Malta Government Scholarship Scheme; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8025793","Augmentation;convolutional neural network;deep learning;fusion;hand-drawn sketch;morphological model","Face;Face recognition;Forensics;Databases;Feature extraction;Solid modeling;Image recognition","","69","","44","IEEE","5 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The eavesdropper is modeled to employ the linear minimum MSE estimator based on the encoded version of the parameter. First, the optimal encoding function is derived when there exist no secrecy constraints. Next, to obtain the solution of the problem in the presence of the secrecy constraint, the form of the encoding function that maximizes the MSE at the eavesdropper is explicitly derived for any given level of worst case Fisher information.

Agents exploit their local measurements and exchange messages with neighbors in the communication network to quickly learn which environment-from a given finite set of presumed ones-is active. Works on such distributed learning setup assumed that the local measurements taken by the agents are uncorrelated over time, a convenient assumption that leaves, however, many practical setups excluded. In this letter, via modifying a recent distributed learning algorithm, we expand distributed learning to environments in which the time correlation of the local measurements is arbitrary. Since correlated measurements invalidate the previous proofs, we need a new proof guaranteeing that the modified distributed learning algorithm succeeds. Our new proof technique is simple, relies only on basic tools such as the Perron-Frobenius and the ergodic Markov chain theorems, and even covers the case of mismatched assumptions-the active environment is not in the finite set of presumed ones.

In the method, the distorted image is converted to grayscale and filtered using gradient operators. Then, the speeded-up robust feature (SURF) technique is employed to detect and describe keypoints in obtained images. The SURF interest point detection method is affected by distortions in the filtered image. Therefore, it can be used to reflect the decreased attention of the human visual system caused by image distortions. In the method, statistics are calculated for processed images and their SURF descriptors. Finally, they are mapped into subjective opinion scores using a support vector regression technique.

We empirically evaluate our method via rigid registration of multicontrast brain images, and demonstrate an often higher registration accuracy in the results produced by the proposed technique, compared to those by several existing methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2754263","National Institutes of Health (NIH); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases(grant numbers:K01DK101631,R21DK108277); National Institute for Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering(grant numbers:P41EB015896,R01EB006758,R21EB018907,R01EB019956); National Institute on Aging(grant numbers:AG022381,5R01AG008122-22,R01AG016495-11,R01AG016495); National Center for Alternative Medicine(grant numbers:RC1AT005728-01); National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke(grant numbers:R01NS052585,R21NS072652,R01NS070963,R01NS083534,U01NS086625); NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research(grant numbers:U01MH093765); BrightFocus Foundation(grant numbers:A2016172S); NIH Shared Instrumentation Grants(grant numbers:S10RR023401,S10RR019307,S10RR023043,S10RR028832); NIH(grant numbers:8R01EB002124-03); Massachusetts General Hospital and Partners HealthCare; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8046076","Multimodal image registration;segmentation-based (SB) image registration","Image segmentation;Image registration;Linear programming;Histograms;Mutual information;Biomedical imaging","","13","","22","IEEE","19 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The most promising approach first applies linear minimum mean square error filtering to the channel output and then computes the LLRs based on a scalar Gaussian approximation of the filter output. The resulting LLRs can be viewed as an approximation of the optimum LLRs. In order to improve the approximation, we investigate the computation of the LLRs based on a vector Gaussian approximation of the filter output, which incorporates the correlation between the estimated symbols after filtering.

However, using convex regularization cannot still obtain the correct sparsity solution under some practical problems including image inverse problems. In this letter, we propose a nonconvex weighted ℓp minimization based group sparse representation framework for image denoising.

This is combined with a variance estimate, obtained by jackknifing over individual spectrum estimates, to produce an estimated MSE for the log spectrum estimate for each choice of time-bandwidth product. The bandwidth that minimizes the estimated MSE then gives the desired spectrum estimate. Additionally, the bandwidth obtained by using our method is also optimal for cepstrum estimates.

In this letter, we consider the case where the state noise of the KF is impulsive, corresponding to a probability density function (PDF) given by the sum of two Gaussians. This will result in a PDF for the state that is given by a sum of Gaussians, corresponding to an implementation of a Gaussian sum filter, with multiple KFs contributing to the resulting output. Simulation and theoretical considerations show that in steady state only one filter is operating, while several filters are important at transitions. The operation of the algorithm is then similar to optimally detecting sudden changes, and restarting the KF at those moments, resulting in an close optimal step size varying algorithm.

Then, the spillover of target energy is incorporated into the design criteria to come up with two architectures capable of guaranteeing improved detection performances and range estimation. The performance assessments, conducted on both simulated data and real recorded datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of the newly proposed detectors compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts, which ignore either the clutter spectral symmetry or the energy spillover.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2756076","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571434); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8049405","Adaptive radar detection;generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT);range estimation;symmetric spectrum","Clutter;Detectors;Estimation;Radar detection;Covariance matrices;Computer architecture","","18","","35","IEEE","25 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Effect of Prosody Modification on Children's ASR","S. Shahnawazuddin; N. Adiga; H. K. Kathania","Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, NIT Patna, Patna, India; Department of Computer Science, University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, NIT Sikkim, Ravangla, India",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,"13 Oct 2017","2017","24","11","1749","1753","Transcribing children's speech using acoustic models trained on adults' speech is very challenging. In such conditions, a highly degraded recognition performance is reported due to large mismatch in the acoustic/linguistic attributes of the training and test data. The differences in pitch (or fundamental frequency) between the two groups of speakers is one among several mismatch factors. Another important mismatch factor is the difference in speaking rates. To overcome these two sources of mismatch, prosody modification is explored in this letter. Prosody modification is done by using glottal closure instants (GCIs) as anchoring points. The GCIs, in turn, are determined using zero-frequency filtering (ZFF). The ZFF-GCI-based prosody modification is fast and results in highly accurate scaling of pitch and speaking rate. The experimental evaluations studying the effect of prosody modification resulted in a relative improvement of 50% over the baseline.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2756347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8049381","Acoustic mismatch;pitch-adaptive features;prosody modification;speech recognition;zero-frequency filter","Speech;Speech recognition;Hidden Markov models;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Training","","32","","37","IEEE","25 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
