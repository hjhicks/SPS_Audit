The spatial-temporal Laplacian graphs not only exploit the sequential consistent information of the target, but also make full use of the geometric structure corresponding to the tasks among the adjacent frames.

This letter presents the steady-state solutions of the predicted system distance and corresponding step size of the FDKF, which is found to be related to the signal-to-noise ratio and the transition parameter. On this basis, it is pointed out that a frequently observed slow reconvergence of the FDKF, when the sudden echo-path change occurs, can be mainly attributed to the over-estimated noise power spectral density.

In practices, the noise would greatly reduce the performance of BCIs. In this study, minima controlled recursive averaging is applied to suppress noise and improve the performance of practical BCI applications. Minima controlled recursive averaging is used to correctively track the noise. To suppress these noises, a log-spectral amplitude estimator is selected as the gain function and used to effectively estimate the power spectrum of the noises. Eight subjects were asked to attend a performance test of the proposed approach and the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was adopted to compare the proposed approach. The average recognition rates based on single channel are 69.57% and 74.63% for CCA and proposed approach, respectively.

However, designing a matching cost function that works on a large window in the same way is difficult. The cost function is typically not intelligent enough to discard the information irrelevant to the target pixel, resulting in undesirable artifacts. In this letter, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) module to learn a stereo matching cost with a large-sized window. Unlike conventional pooling layers with strides, the proposed per-pixel pyramid-pooling layer can cover a large area without a loss of resolution and detail. Therefore, the learned matching cost function can successfully utilize the information from a large area without introducing the fattening effect. The proposed method is robust despite the presence of weak textures, depth discontinuity, illumination, and exposure difference. The proposed method achieves near-peak performance on the Middlebury benchmark.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2637355","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7778222","Convolutional neural network (CNN);pooling;stereo matching","Computer architecture;Cost function;Convolution;Neural networks;Neural networks;Benchmark testing;Stereo matching","","75","","28","IEEE","8 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, we first introduce a unified formulation for Bayesian and non-Bayesian projection-based lower bounds and set a general framework, which allows for their approximation via a greedy-based method. This framework is then used to propose the use of optimized orthogonal matching pursuit approach for computing projection-based large-error bounds. We analyze the complexity of the proposed algorithm and show that it is significantly lower than the complexity of the conventional approach.

However, its performance is often degraded when the bounding box is not tight enough or covers large background regions. To solve this problem, this letter proposes a novel segmentation algorithm called “SuperCut”. This algorithm provides robust segmentation in one cut even with loose bounding boxes. In the proposed SuperCut, superpixels of the whole image are first computed, and then a background similarity map for the superpixels inside the bounding box is created based on Haar-Wavelet feature and pixel intensities. Finally, a max-flow cut is made based on the map. The background similarity map reduces the influence from possible background regions inside the bounding box, which leads to the efficient segmentation of SuperCut. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed SuperCut, we compared it with some recent published interactive image segmentation techniques. The experimental results show that the proposed SuperCut outperforms other compared methods especially when using loose bounding boxes.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2761393","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Japan Science and Technology Agency; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8063417","Bounding box;GrabCut;Graph cut;interactive image segmentation;OneCut","Image segmentation;Signal processing algorithms;Image color analysis;Training data;Histograms;Graphical models","","12","","23","IEEE","9 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To solve the problem, we have presented a pore extraction method using deep convolutional neural networks and pore intensity refinement.

The objective function of CADL mainly includes two parts to promote the discriminability. The first part aims to learn a discriminative analysis subdictionary for each class instead of a global dictionary for all classes. The learned analysis dictionary is class-aware, generating a block-diagonal coding coefficient matrix. The second part aims to enhance the discrimination of coding coefficients by integrating a max-margin regularization term into our proposed framework. This term ensures the coefficients of different classes to be separated by a max-margin, which boosts the confidence of classification. A theoretical analysis is also given to support the max-margin regularization term from the perspective of preserving the pairwise relations of samples in coding space. We employ an alternating minimization algorithm to iteratively find the convergent solution.

It was shown that the human comprehension of conflict intensity is closely related to speaker overlap; that is, when multiple persons are speaking at the same time. This type of information can also aid automated conflict intensity estimation. In this study, we propose a simple, DNN-based feature extraction step, and show that this approach is superior to those introduced in the literature so far: By combining our results with an efficient greedy feature selection algorithm, we were able to outperform all previous results on the SSPNet conflict dataset, achieving a correlation coefficient of 0.856 on the test set.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2736008","János Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8002607","Computational paralinguistics;conflict intensity estimation;deep neural networks (DNNs);feature extraction","Feature extraction;Estimation;Speech processing;Correlation;Neural networks;Learning systems;Neural networks","","6","","35","IEEE","4 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such methods are traditionally formulated as optimization problems that are solved iteratively by simultaneously enforcing data consistency and incorporating prior models. Recently, the Plug-and-Play Priors (PPP) framework suggested that by using more sophisticated denoisers, not necessarily corresponding to an optimization objective, it is possible to improve the quality of reconstructed images. In this letter, we show that the PPP approach is applicable beyond linear inverse problems. In particular, we develop the fast iterative shrinkage/thresholding algorithm variant of PPP for model-based nonlinear inverse scattering. The key advantage of the proposed formulation over the original ADMM-based one is that it does not need to perform an inversion on the forward model.

With the joint supervision of softmax loss and correlation loss, the deep correlation feature learning (DCFL) network can learn the deep features with both the interclass separability and the intraclass compactness, which are highly discriminative for face verification. More importantly, by applying the weight vector of softmax function as the class prototype, the proposed correlation loss function is easy to be optimized during the backpropatation of CNN.

It is based on the sparsity of the number of nonzero elements and singular values, which leads to an optimization problem. Since the problem is NP-hard, relaxation and adjustment are applied to make it convex. The DNM method can be applied in many practical networks, as many real-world complex networks are sparse.
