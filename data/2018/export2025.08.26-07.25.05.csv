In coding applications, neither the covariance matrix nor the eigenvectors can be easily transmitted to the decoder. In this letter, we introduce a covariance matrix model based on graphs determined by hierarchical block motion in image sequences and use its eigenvector matrix for compression. The covariance matrix model is defined using the graph distance matrix, where the graph is determined by block motion. As the proposed covariance matrix is closely related to the graph, the relation between the covariance matrix and the Laplacian matrix is studied and their eigenvector matrices are discussed. From our assumptions, we show that our covariance model can be viewed as a Gaussian graphical model where the signal is described by the second order statistics and the zeros in the precision matrix indicate missing edges in the graph. To assess the compression performance, we relate the coding gain due to the eigenbasis of the covariance model to that of the Laplacian eigenbasis. The experimental results show that the eigenbasis of our covariance model is advantageous for tree-structured block motion in image sequences.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2769002","Swedish Research Council(grant numbers:2011-5841); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8093650","Covariance model;hierarchical coding of image sequences;motion-adaptive transform coding","Covariance matrices;Laplace equations;Transforms;Correlation;Encoding;Matrix decomposition;Image sequences","","2","","25","IEEE","1 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Additionally, they ignore the spatial continuity prior among the neighbor foreground pixels. Consequently, they cannot offer a satisfactory performance in practical dynamic background. In this letter, we present a unified regularization framework, namely l1/2-norm and spatial continuity regularized low-rank approximation (SCLR-l1/2), to solve this problem. First, in order to promote accuracy, we introduce an l1/2 constraint into the framework. Second, to guarantee the continuity among the neighbor foreground pixels, we introduce a spatial continuity regularization term, motivated by total variation. Finally, we generalize our framework to the lq-norm penalized case (SCLR-lq). By adjusting the shrinkage parameter q, the framework gets better flexibility to choose a reasonable sparse domain. To deal with the present constrained minimization problem, the augmented Lagrange multiplier method is employed and extended with the help of the alternating direction minimizing strategy. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art algorithms especially for the cases with dynamic backgrounds.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2768582","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8093628","  ${{\boldsymbol{l}}_{1/2}}$   regularization;dynamic background;foreground detection;low-rank modeling;total variation (TV)","Sparse matrices;TV;Object detection;Optimization;Matrix decomposition;Adaptation models;Heuristic algorithms","","26","","11","IEEE","1 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Conventionally, the Lyapunov exponent is used as an index to identify different states, but as this indicator has the problem of heavy computation cost, slow convergence rate, and requires a mass of data, its application becomes seriously limits. To solve this problem, a novel method for state identification of the Duffing oscillator based on extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed.

In this letter, we present a novel depth representation for RGB-D scene classification based on a specific designed convolutional neural network (CNN). Contrast to previous deep models that transfer from pretrained RGB CNN models, we harness model by using the multiviewpoint depth image augmentation to overcome the data scarcity problem. The proposed CNN framework contains the dilated convolutions to expand the receptive field and a subsequent spatial pooling to aggregate multiscale contextual information. The combination of contextual design and multiviewpoint depth images are important toward a more compact representation, compared to directly using original depth images or off-the-shelf networks. Through extensive experiments on SUN RGB-D dataset, we demonstrate that the representation outperforms recent state of the arts, and combining it with standard CNN-based RGB features can lead to further improvements.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2764489","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61602459); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality(grant numbers:17511101902); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8074737","Context-aware representation;multiviewpoint depth images;RGB-D images;scene classification","Image color analysis;Data models;Geometry;Convolution;Three-dimensional displays;Training","","8","","35","IEEE","19 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, synthesizing multiple heterogeneous features to learn a comprehensive description of the data samples is challenging. To tackle this problem, many methods explore the correlations among various features across different views by the assumption that all views share the common semantic information. Following this line, in this letter, we propose a new unsupervised multiview nonnegative correlated feature learning (UMCFL) method for data clustering. Different from the existing methods that only focus on projecting features from different views to a shared semantic subspace, our method learns view-specific features and captures inter-view feature correlations in the latent common subspace simultaneously. By separating the view-specific features from the shared feature representation, the effect of the individual information of each view can be removed. Thus, UMCFL can capture flexible feature correlations hidden in multiview data. A new objective function is designed and efficient optimization processes are derived to solve the proposed UMCFL. Extensive experiments on real-world multiview datasets demonstrate that the proposed UMCFL method is superior to the state-of-the-art multiview clustering methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2769086","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672123,U1301253); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8093996","Correlated feature learning;data clustering, multiview data;unsupervised learning","Optimization;Correlation;Semantics;Sparse matrices;Linear programming;Clustering methods;Clustering algorithms","","22","","22","IEEE","2 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Results show that SQC largely overcomes the results obtained by ITU-T Recommendation P.563.

Training-based approaches can be tuned to give high accuracy on a given class of images, but they call for retraining if the HR → LR generative model deviates or if the test images belong to a different class, which limits their applicability. On the other hand, we propose a solution that does not require a training dataset. Our method relies on constructing a dynamic convolutional network (DCN) to learn the relation between the consecutive scales of Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids. The relation is in turn used to predict the detail at a finer scale, thus leading to SR. Comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques on standard datasets show that the proposed DCN approach results in about 0.8 and 0.3 dB gain in peak signal-to-noise ratio for 2× and 3× SR, respectively. The structural similarity index is on par with the competing techniques.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2752806","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8038812","Convolutional neural network (CNN);deep learning;dynamic convolutional network (DCN);Gaussian/Laplacian pyramids;super-resolution (SR)","Laplace equations;Training;Image resolution;Signal resolution;Feature extraction;Convolution;Dictionaries","","14","","37","IEEE","15 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For this purpose and based on the recently proposed JDE framework, this letter proposes a conditional JDE (CJDE) risk, which integrates the tracking error and the classification cost using heterogeneous sensor data. Object classes differ from each other in maneuverability and feature attribute. A suitable model is identified and used to describe object classes differing in maneuverability. Also presented are attribute evolution and measurement models. Then, an EOTC algorithm optimizing the CJDE risk is proposed, which considers the coupling and the information contained in various data.

A locally optimum detector is first devised assuming that the signal is nonsparse by approximating the test statistic around zero using a Taylor series, which is a good estimate only in a small radius around zero. When the signal is sparse, it is shown that the performance of this test degrades. To improve its performance, a new test is devised by deriving the Padé approximation of the test statistic around zero. Padé approximants estimate functions as the rational quotient of two lower degree polynomials and consistently have a wider radius of convergence than the Taylor series. The performance of the Padé-approximated test is better than its Taylor series counterpart and is comparable to the conventional locally optimum test with uncompressed measurements.

In current methods based on harmonic analysis, a sound field is decomposed into harmonic functions with a center given in advance, which is called a global origin, and their coefficients are obtained up to a certain truncation order using microphone measurements. However, the accuracy of the reconstructed sound field depends on the predefined position of the global origin and the truncation order, which makes it difficult to apply this technique to an asymmetric array since the criterion to determine the position of the global origin and the truncation order is not obvious. We formulate an estimate of the harmonic coefficients on the basis of infinite-order analysis. This formulation enables us to estimate the harmonic coefficients at an arbitrary desired position independently of the position of the global origin without truncation errors. Numerical simulation results indicated that the proposed method makes it possible to avoid performance degradation caused by inappropriate setting of the global origin.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2775242","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP15H05312,JP16H01735); SECOM Science and Technology Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8116652","Circular/spherical harmonics;microphone array;sound field recording;sound field reproduction","Harmonic analysis;Microphone arrays;Two dimensional displays;Three-dimensional displays;Mathematical model;Geometry","","67","","24","OAPA","21 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fingerprinting algorithm maps the perceptual contents of media file to an invariant digest, so that unauthorized copies can be identified via fingerprint comparison. This letter presents a distortion-resistant sparse coding strategy for image fingerprinting that simulates the hierarchical information processing flow of visual system. Sparse coding, which seeks a small set of atoms that can best represent input signal, helps fingerprinting algorithm detect the intrinsic visual features of image. However, the high freedom of atom selection makes sparse coding sensitive to distortion. In this letter, several measures are applied on sparse coding and dictionary learning to jointly ensure the invariance of fingerprint, such as imposing the neighborhood-priority principle on atom selection, regulating the layout of atoms, and forcing sparse codes to preserve the distance in the image space. Content identification performance of the proposed work was tested on a database of 219 000 images.

In this letter, we formulate them as a unified optimization problem and take the advantage of high-order information to capture the interrelations for Motion Segmentation by Trajectory Association and Clustering (MSTAC). To solve this unified problem, we propose an alternating optimization strategy to improve the association and clustering in each iteration. Specifically, a tensor-based multidimensional assignment method with high-order motion context information is proposed for trajectory association; and a minimum cost multicut-based trajectory clustering method is introduced for trajectory clustering. While the association process provides incomplete trajectories to clustering, the clustering method presents high-order context information to improve the performance of association; and thus they benefit from each other. Experiments on the Hopkins 155 dataset and a realistic airport sequence demonstrate that the proposed MSTAC framework obtains high accuracy on both trajectory association and clustering.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2773636","National Technology Support Program of China(grant numbers:2015BAK01B05); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1605254,61528204); US NSF(grant numbers:1350521,1618398); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8110638","Multicut-based clustering;motion segmentation;tensor-based association","Trajectory;Motion segmentation;Computer vision;Optimization;Tracking;Signal processing algorithms;Complexity theory","","7","","29","IEEE","15 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
