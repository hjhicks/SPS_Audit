Nevertheless, almost all the conventional solutions are still not robust enough to handle video sequences captured by hand-hold cameras. This is mainly due to the absence of the position alignment information that is indispensable for top-down background modeling. In contrast, the bottom-up video saliency detection methods, though achieving excellent salient motion detection in either stationary or nonstationary videos, still have rather poor detection performance in scenarios with massive dynamic background. In this letter, we explore a bottom-up saliency framework by introducing a novel spatial-temporal regional filter method to handle the dynamic background problem. Our key rationale is to assign large saliency value to those regions with stable spatial-temporal coherency while eliminating irregular, repeating dynamic background. As far as we know, this is the first work to address the dynamic background problem from the perspective of the bottom-up video saliency. We conduct massive quantitative evaluations over public available benchmarks to validate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2775212","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:0949467,1047715,1049448); Applied Basic Research Program of Qingdao(grant numbers:16013xx); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61190120,61190124,61190125,61300067,61532002,61602341,61672077,6167214,61772277); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8115181","Dynamic background;nonstationary video;spatial-temporal coherency;spatial-temporal regional filter;video saliency","Dynamics;Optical filters;Robustness;Cameras;Spatial coherence;Motion detection;Jitter","","25","","32","IEEE","20 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The sensors collect the observations and forward them to a fusion center via applying a phase-only beamforming weight. The derivation of the optimal beamforming weights requires the solution of a unit-modulus quadratic program (UQP), which in the relevant literature is solved via the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique or via a variation of the analytic constant modulus algorithm. The former achieves better performance, though it exhibits high computational cost that increases drastically with the number of sensors. The latter requires much less complexity, though it achieves worse performance. To that end, we propose an efficient algorithm for the solution of UQPs based on the alternating direction method of multipliers. The new approach achieves almost identical performance to that of the SDR-based approach while exhibiting significantly reduced computational complexity. The convergence of the proposed algorithm to a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker point is theoretically studied, and its effectiveness is verified via numerical results.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2779276","Luxembourg National Research Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8125772","Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM);analog sensor networks;distributed beamforming;unit-modulus quadratic program (UQP);wireless sensor networks (WSNs)","Sensors;Array signal processing;Wireless sensor networks;Signal processing algorithms;Complexity theory;Convergence;Estimation","","34","","33","IEEE","4 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, traditional methods have not fully exploited its power due to improper assumptions or operations, which cause unwanted artifacts. The postrefinement algorithms employed to remove these artifacts in turn undermine the merits of the prior. In this letter, a novel method for estimating transmission map by energy minimization is proposed to solve this problem. The energy function combines the dark channel prior with piecewise smoothness.

The presence of consecutive multiple actions in video sequences makes the temporal segmentation a challenging problem due to the unconstrained nature of actions in space and time. To address this issue, we exploit the nonaction segments present between the actual human actions in uncut videos. From the long uncut video, we compute the energy of consecutive nonoverlapping motion history images (MHIs), which provides spatiotemporal information of motion. Our proposals from MHIs (PMHI) are based on clustering the MHIs into actions and nonaction segments by detecting minima from the energy of MHIs. PMHI efficiently segments the long uncut videos into a small number of nonoverlapping temporal action proposals. The strength of PMHI is that it is unsupervised, which alleviates the requirement for any training data.

Only a set of GMM parameters is stored and used instead of all the costs for each pixel. We also propose GMM parameter update-based aggregation along multiple paths. To preserve the accuracy of the disparity map, we employ a depth confidence measure and propose an update rule for the slanted surface of an object.

We preliminary screened the data using standard deviation analysis (STD). Then, we compared and combined STD values with coefficients from wavelet decomposition (Daubechies mother wavelet of order 4). Resulting parameters were classified using an artificial neural network. STD analysis underlined two brain areas [superior temporal sulcus (STS) and intraparietal-sulcus and parietal transverse (IPS)] with different electrical activity in the two states. STD values of STS and IPS channels were highly correlated in time; therefore, only STS was then used further in the features extraction analysis. Approximation and detail coefficients from Daubechies decomposition were used alone or in combination with the STD value.

In the metric, local video compression distortions in left and right view are measured in both spatial and temporal channels by considering contrast and motion masking effect. Then, a stereo saliency based pooling strategy is used to accumulate local spatial and temporal distortions. Finally, 3-D-PQI is derived from texture energy based fusion of distortion measurement of left and right view.

In this letter, we propose a color decomposition to preprocess an image before applying a typical denoising. Our decomposition consists in obtaining a set of images in the spherical coordinate system, each of them with the origin of the spherical transformation in a different color value. These color values, that we call color centers, are defined so as to be far away from the dominant colors of the image. Once in the spherical coordinate system, we perform a mild denoising operation with some state-of-the-art method in the angular components. Then, we convert these images back to sRGB, and we merge them depending on the distance between the color of each pixel and the color centers. Finally, we denoise the preprocessed image with the same state-of-the-art method used in our preprocessing.

The settings can be used to select appropriate parameters for denoising methods. But denoising methods based on deep convolutional neural networks (deep-CNN) do not have such adjustable parameters. Therefore, a deep-CNN whose training data contain limited levels of noise does not effectively restore images whose noise level is different from the training data. If the range of noise levels of training data is extended to solve the problem, the maximum performance of a produced deep-CNN is limited. To solve the tradeoff, we propose a deep-CNN that is adjustable to the noise level of the input image immediately. We use soft shrinkage for activation functions of our deep-CNN. The soft shrinkage has thresholds proportional to the noise level given by the user. We also propose an optimization method for proportionality coefficients for the thresholds of soft shrinkage. Our method optimizes the coefficients for various noise levels simultaneously.

By dividing each ULA into some overlapping subarrays and then combining their received signals into a data tensor, a new cross-correlation tensor between the two data tensors from the two ULAs is built. Analyses show that such a cross-correlation tensor can be transformed into an equivalent received data matrix of a virtual uniform rectangular array (URA). Under the constraint of a fixed actual number of physical sensors, the optimal number of the subarrays is found by maximizing the DOF of the URA. It is shown that a virtual URA with approximately 0.34(M + 1)2 DOF can be obtained from an L-shaped array with 2M physical sensors. To exploit the increased DOF for the two dimensional (2-D) DOA estimation without the multidimensional search, a parallel factor (PARAFAC) model of the URA is provided so that the PARAFAC decomposition can be utilized to do the 2-D DOA estimation effectively.

In massive MIMO, antenna selection (AS) is still an effective way to decrease the number of radio frequency chains. In this letter, the AS problem in massive MIMO systems is studied with the consideration of maximizing the channel capacity. To eliminate the limitation of the traditional square maximum-volume (SMV) AS method, the theory of rectangular maximum-volume (RMV) submatrices is introduced. An AS algorithm based on RMV method is also developed for massive MIMO, which can be regarded as a postprocessing of the results of SMV method. Based on the result obtained from SMV method, the proposed algorithm can select a rectangular submatrix with maximum-volume from the channel matrix.

However, the nuclear norm defined as the sum of all the singular values of a matrix is not a good approximation to the rank of mocap data. This paper proposes a novel approach to solve mocap data completion problem by adopting a new matrix norm, called truncated nuclear norm. An efficient iterative algorithm is designed to solve this problem based on the augmented Lagrange multiplier. The convergence of the proposed method is proved mathematically under mild conditions.

The problem is of strong practical relevance since many imaging devices, such as cellphone cameras, must rely on deblurring algorithms to yield satisfactory image quality. Despite significant research effort, handling large motions remains an open problem. In this letter, we develop a new method called blind image deblurring using row-column sparsity (BD-RCS) to address this issue. Specifically, we model the outer product of kernel and image coefficients in certain transformation domains as a rank-one matrix, and recover it by solving a rank minimization problem. Our central contribution then includes solving two new optimization problems involving RCS to automatically determine blur kernel and image support sequentially. The kernel and image can then be recovered through a singular value decomposition. Experimental results on linear motion deblurring demonstrate that BD-RCS can yield better results than state of the art, particularly when the blur is caused by large motion. This is confirmed both visually and through quantitative measures.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2782570","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8186241","Blind image deblurring;motion blur kernel;rank minimization;row and column sparsity","Kernel;Deconvolution;Image restoration;Optimization;Image edge detection;Cameras;Image quality","","15","","40","IEEE","11 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Softmax loss is widely used in deep learning networks, but it is indirect for face verification. Center loss is effective to improve intraclass compactness, while interclass distances are ignored. In this letter, we propose a novel loss function, termed margin loss, to enlarge distances of interclass and reduce intraclass variations simultaneously. Margin loss aims to focus on samples hard to classify by a distance margin. Different from Softmax loss, margin loss is based on Euclidean distances that can directly measure face similarity. Experiments on different datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2789251","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61471216,61771276); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2016YFB0101001,2017YFC0112500); Special Foundation for the Development of Strategic Emerging Industries of Shenzhen(grant numbers:JCYJ20170307153940960,JCYJ20150831192224146); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8245803","Center loss;deep learning;margin loss","Training;Face recognition;Machine learning;Loss measurement;Signal processing algorithms;Databases","","28","","26","IEEE","3 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Off-Grid Localization in MIMO Radars Using Sparsity","A. Abtahi; S. Gazor; F. Marvasti","Advanced Communications Research Institute, Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, Canada; Advanced Communications Research Institute, Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,"22 Jan 2018","2018","25","2","313","317","In this letter, we propose a new accurate approach for target localization in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radars, which exploits the sparse spatial distribution of targets to reduce the sampling rate. We express the received signal of a MIMO radar in terms of the deviations of target parameters from the grid points in the form of a block sparse signal using the expansion around all the neighbor points. Applying a block sparse recovery method, we can estimate both the grid-point locations of targets and these deviations. The proposed approach can yield more accurate localization with higher detection probability compared with its counterparts. Moreover, the proposed approach can reduce the computational complexity.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2791447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8252808","Compressive sensing (CS);multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar;off-grid localization;random sampling;sparse recovery","MIMO radar;Receivers;Transmitters;Sparse matrices;Additive noise;Compressed sensing","","25","","46","IEEE","9 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
