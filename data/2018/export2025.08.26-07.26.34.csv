Such degradation not only affects the quality of underwater images, but limits the ability of vision tasks. Different from existing methods that either ignore the wavelength dependence on the attenuation or assume a specific spectral profile, we tackle color distortion problem of underwater images from a new view. In this letter, we propose a weakly supervised color transfer method to correct color distortion. The proposed method relaxes the need for paired underwater images for training and allows the underwater images being taken in unknown locations. Inspired by cycle-consistent adversarial networks, we design a multiterm loss function including adversarial loss, cycle consistency loss, and structural similarity index measure loss, which makes the content and structure of the outputs same as the inputs, meanwhile the color is similar to the images that were taken without the water. Experiments on underwater images captured under diverse scenes show that our method produces visually pleasing results, even outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, our method can improve the performance of vision tasks.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2792050","National Key Basic Research Program of China(grant numbers:2014CB340403); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771334); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8253820","Color casts;color correction;color transfer;Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs);underwater image","Image color analysis;Atmospheric modeling;Training;Visualization;Loss measurement;Scattering","","460","","41","IEEE","11 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, we exploit the fact that uncertainty propagation can be achieved in closed form for Gaussian mixture acoustic models (GMMs). We introduce new GMM-derived (GMMD) uncertainty features for the robust DNN-based acoustic model training and decoding. The GMMD features are computed as the difference between the GMM log-likelihoods obtained with versus without uncertainty. They are concatenated with conventional acoustic features and used as inputs to the DNN. We evaluate the resulting ASR performance on the CHiME-2 and CHiME-3 datasets.

Binary measurements are fast to acquire and inexpensive in terms of hardware. We formulate the problem of signal reconstruction using a consistency criterion, wherein one seeks to find a signal that is in agreement with the acquired measurements. To enforce consistency, we construct a convex cost using a one-sided quadratic penalty and minimize it using an iterative accelerated projected gradient-descent technique. The projected gradient-descent (PGD) scheme reduces the cost function in each iteration, whereas incorporating momentum into PGD, notwithstanding the lack of such a descent property, exhibits faster convergence than PGD empirically. We refer to the resulting algorithm as binary phase retrieval (BPR). Considering additive white noise contamination prior to quantization, we also derive the Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) for the binary encoding model. Experimental results demonstrate that the BPR algorithm yields a signal-to-reconstruction error ratio (SRER) of approximately 25 dB in the absence of noise. In the presence of noise prior to quantization, the SRER is within 2 to 3 dB of the CRB.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2791102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8249796","Accelerated projected gradient-descent (APGD);binary phase retrieval (BPR);consistent reconstruction;Cramér–Rao Bound (CRB);lifting","Business process re-engineering;Pollution measurement;Phase measurement;Signal processing algorithms;Quantization (signal);Encoding;Signal reconstruction","","10","","54","IEEE","8 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To reduce the number of adaptive parameters, the feedback path is usually modeled with a transfer function composed of an invariant component and a variable component using all-pole, all-zero, and pole-zero filters. These filters may be inefficient, requiring a large number of parameters for their specification, particularly in reverberant environments. In this letter, we present a weighted least-squares algorithm to precisely estimate the common poles of feedback paths, and we then model the invariant basis functions employing a Kautz filter. The Kautz filter is defined by a set of the fixed poles and a corresponding set of tap output weights. The fixed poles are associated with prominent peaks that are common to the measured feedback path frequency responses. The algorithm guarantees unconditionally the stability of the estimated poles of the inferred model. The experimental results using measured acoustic feedback paths from a two-microphone, behind-the-ear hearing aid show that the proposed method provides an accurate model of the feedback paths for a variety of acoustic environments that were not employed in estimating the common poles.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2785355","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231177","Common acoustical poles;feedback path (FP) modeling;kautz filter;stability;weighted least-squares (WLS) estimation","Estimation;Computational modeling;Transfer functions;Adaptation models;Acoustics;Signal processing algorithms;Stability analysis","","5","","25","IEEE","20 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The two threshold rates where the error variance deviates from the lower bound gives two optimality criteria for sampling lattices. It is proved that at low rates, near the first threshold, the optimal lattice is the dual of the best sphere-covering lattice, which for the first time establishes a rigorous relation between optimal sampling and optimal sphere covering.

Since depth maps are not displayed to viewers but to generate virtual views, the quality of depth maps needs to be measured by its effect on the virtual view quality, which is indicated by the virtual view distortion (VVD) in depth map coding. In this letter, a fine VVD estimation method is proposed based on the analysis of the VVD. Specifically, the depth distortion of the current pixel, the texture gradient of the colocated color video and the depth distortions of adjacent pixels are all taken into consideration to estimate the VVD accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve 13.1% bitrate saving compared with the sum of squared differences based depth distortion calculation method and can improve 1.2% bitrate saving compared with the VVD estimation method in three dimensional high efficiency video coding (3D-HEVC) reference software.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2723910","NSF of China(grant numbers:61571274); 111 Project(grant numbers:B08038); Shandong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar(grant numbers:JQ201614); Young Scholars Program of Shandong University(grant numbers:2015WLJH39); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7970181","Multiview video plus depth (MVD);rate-distortion optimization (RDO);three dimensional high efficiency video coding (3D-HEVC);3-D video (3DV);virtual view distortion (VVD)","Distortion;Image analysis;Encoding;Estimation;Three-dimensional displays;Color;Image color analysis","","8","","23","IEEE","6 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to exclude the impact of outliers, an alternate sampling and clustering strategy is performed, that iteratively alternates between sampling the hypotheses within the clusters and clustering the points with the permutation preference. As a result, points with similar permutation preferences are sampled as the hypotheses, and outliers are effectively excluded, thus, making the preferences more distinguishable and improving the clustering. The iterative interaction between sampling and clustering results in a good convergent result. The proposed method obtains robust segmentation results with the Hopkins 155 dataset, which are better than the results obtained by the state-of-the-art methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2777997","National Natural Science Foundation Project(grant numbers:61261130587,61571332); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8120119","Motion segmentation;permutation preference;sampling and clustering","Motion segmentation;Computer vision;Couplings;Shape;Tracking;Image color analysis;Clustering algorithms","","9","","44","IEEE","27 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A common approach to binary embedding is to use random projection, followed by one-bit quantization to produce binary codes. Of particular interest, in this letter, is sparse circulant binary embedding (SCBE), where a sparse random circulant matrix with random sampling at a rate of 1 - s for s E (0, 1) is used for random projection. The SCBE has the space complexity O((1 - s)d), while unstructured random projection has the space complexity O(d2). We present an asymptotic analysis of SCBE, when d approaches ∞, showing that the performance of SCBE is comparable to that of binary embedding with unstructured random projection whilethe former has the space complexity O((1 - s)d) and the time complexity O(d log d) but the latter has both space and time complexities O(d2).","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2794768","NAVER; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8260897","Binary embedding (BE);circulant matrix;locality-sensitive hashing;random projection;sparse embedding","Hamming distance;Sparse matrices;Binary codes;Time complexity;Convergence;Quantization (signal)","","","","17","IEEE","17 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The distortion of an electrical signal visible in the final image is a major problem in ultrasonography. To solve this problem, the bit length in Golay-complementary sequences was elongated, narrowing the fractional bandwidth of the coded sequences. Therefore, more energy of the burst signal could be transferred through the ultrasound transducer. The experimental results obtained for transmission of the complementary Golay-coded sequences with two different bit lengths-one-cycle and two-cycles-have been compared, and the efficiency of the pulse compression and its influence on the axial resolution for two fractional bandwidths have been discussed. The results are presented for two transducers having a fractional bandwidth of 25% and 80% and operating at a 6-MHz frequency. The results obtained show that the elongation of the Golay single bit length (doubled in our case) compensate for the limited transducer bandwidth. Two-dimensional ultrasound images of a tissue-mimicking phantom are presented and demonstrate the benefits of the use of two-cycle bit length.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2776040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8115266","Coded excitation;Golay sequences;synthetic aperture method;transducer bandwidth;ultrasound imaging","Bandwidth;Transducers;Ultrasonic imaging;Correlation;Matched filters;Image coding;Image resolution","","3","","20","IEEE","20 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The existing methods consider inclusively ambiguous data to represent a sign and ignore the fact that only scarce key information can represent the sign efficiently since most information are redundant. Furthermore, inclusion of redundant information may result in inefficiency and difficulty in modeling the long-term dependency for SLR. This letter delivers a novel sequence-to-sequence learning method based on keyframe centered clips (KCCs) for Chinese SLR. Different from conventional methods, only key information is considered to represent a sign significantly. The frames-to-word task is transformed into a KCCs-to-subwords task successfully, to allow for different attention in the input data.
