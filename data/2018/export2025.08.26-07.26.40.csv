The secondary filter makes available its probabilistic data predictor, but an explicit Bayesian conditioning mechanism between the filters is assumed to be unavailable. Thus, fully probabilistic design is adopted. This leads to a novel and fully tractable three-step recursive extension of the traditional Kalman filter flow, involving an extra data-like step for merging the secondary data predictor. An adapted form of the algorithm yields performance in simulation equal to that of measurement vector fusion, with the advantage that the Bayesian design allows full distributional knowledge to be transferred. There is flexibility in the way probabilistic knowledge transfer between interacting Kalman filters can be specified using this optimal Bayesian design strategy, and these options are discussed in the letter.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2776223","Fulbright Commission, and of GAČR grants (Czech Republic)(grant numbers:GA16-09848S,GA18-15970S); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8167323","Fully probabilistic design (FPD);Kalman filter (KF);knowledge transfer;Kullback–Leibler divergence (KLD);measurement vector fusion (MVF);predictor;transfer learning","Bayes methods;Kalman filters;Knowledge transfer;Probabilistic logic;Stochastic processes;Computational modeling;Predictive models","","25","","9","IEEE","7 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To improve the quality of initial saliency maps, existing algorithms typically refine them via a neighbor-constrained smoothing model, which assigns similar saliency values to neighboring regions. Since the adjacent regions could also cross the boundary between the salient object and background, these spatial distance-based methods easily cause false detection by involving the background regions that are close to the salient objects. To address this problem, we propose a boundary-guided optimization framework to jointly improve the region smoothness and correct the false detect regions. Specifically, we introduce a latent segmentation variable to regularize the consistency between the refined saliency map and the latent segmentation mask, which penalizes high (low) saliency values of the regions lying outside (inside) the estimated object boundary. To optimize the proposed objective function, we decompose the primary problem into two subproblems: submodular optimization problem and convex optimization problem. The submodular optimization problem can be quickly optimized using the off-the-shelf technique while the convex optimization can be solved with a closed-form solution. The experimental results show that the proposed method consistently improve the performances of eight state-of-the-art salient object detection algorithms on three datasets, including latest deep convolutional neural network-based algorithms.

The proposed method whitens the distribution of rows and columns of an image matrix. The main contribution of this letter is to investigate some aspects of recently published studies on this topic. We point out that existing methods on 2-D whitening for face recognition overlook the rows as potential random vectors, implying that the image matrix is only a collection of independent identically distributed column vectors. This study shows that this one-sided whitening approach relies on an incorrect assumption for image data. We show that one-sided whitening replaces the covariance matrix along one dimension with the identity matrix. Our proposed, truely 2-D, whitening transform does not enforce any such restriction on the row- or column-covariance matrices. A second contribution of our letter is to illustrate a method to confirm that the rows and columns of front-pose face images are in fact approximately normally distributed.

The trunk network, trained by face images of three significantly different resolutions, is used to extract discriminative features robust to the resolution change. Two branch networks, trained by HR images and images of the targeted LR, work as resolution-specific CMs to transform HR and corresponding LR features to a space where their difference is minimized. Model parameters of branch networks are optimized using our proposed CM loss function, which considers not only the discriminability of HR and LR features, but also the similarity between them. In order to deal with various possible resolutions of probe images, we train multiple pairs of small branch networks while using the same trunk network.

However, these two types of information are mixed in the feature vectors that need to be separated based on learning from the training data. The limited training data may not be able to well separate these two types of information and hence limits the effectiveness of metric learning. This letter proposes to exploit off-feature information to help suppress the intraclass variation of the feature vectors. For face recognition, some identity-independent information such as pose, expression, and occlusion is extracted from source images and utilized as the off-feature information to enhance the performance of distance metric learning. In training, the algorithm learns how to incorporate the off-feature information to suppress the intraclass variation of features. In recognition, the similarity score of a face image pair is determined by its distance in feature space and that of off-feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed off-feature information incorporated metric learning is helpful to suppress the intraclass variation of feature vectors, which visibly enhances the existing metric learning algorithms.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2810106","Rapid-Rich Object Search (ROSE) Lab; Nanyang Technological University, Singapore; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:SWU115062); Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund(grant numbers:1 RG27/14 RG 123/15); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8303207","Face recognition;metric learning;off-feature information;pose and expression estimation","Face;Measurement;Feature extraction;Signal processing algorithms;Face recognition;Data mining;Training","","5","","23","IEEE","27 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To overcome these problems, we propose a semisupervised learning (SSL) road detection method based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and a weakly supervised learning (WSL) method based on conditional GANs. Specifically, in our SSL method, the generator generates the road detection results of labeled and unlabeled images, and then they are fed into the discriminator, which assigns a label on each input to judge whether it is labeled. Additionally, in WSL method we add another network to predict road shapes of input images and use them in both generator and discriminator to constrain the learning progress. By training under these frameworks, the discriminators can guide a latent annotation process on the unlabeled data; therefore, the networks can learn better representations of road areas and leverage the feature distributions on both labeled and unlabeled data. The experiments are carried out on KITTI ROAD benchmark, and the results show our methods achieve the state-of-the-art performances.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2809685","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8302923","Generative adversarial networks;road detection;semi-supervised learning","Roads;Training;Shape;Generators;Gallium nitride;Image segmentation;Network architecture","","71","","26","IEEE","26 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This letter proposes a geographical information enhanced cooperative localizer (GIE-CL) for VANET with time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements. It iterates between NLOS identification and extended generalized approximate message passing (EGAMP) motivated cooperative positioning. A region sampling method is developed to identify NLOS measurements based on geographical information and current vehicle position estimations. Subsequently, the detected NLOS measurements are removed and the EGAMP localizer is activated to re-estimate the vehicle positions. The above-mentioned iteration will be terminated until convergence is reached. Initial positions are provided by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Simulation results show that GIE-CL can handle the NLOS problem, and approach to its performance upper bound provided by the case with known NLOS/LOS link-type information. Compared to EGAMP localizer, the positioning accuracy of GIE-CL is improved by eight times when the allowed localization error is less than 5 m.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2806374","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601048); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8292885","Approximate message passing;cooperative localizer;geographical;NLOS;VANET","Global navigation satellite system;Buildings;Current measurement;Sampling methods;Estimation;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Position measurement","","25","","24","IEEE","15 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although effective, traditional upsampling methods exhibit certain drawbacks. For example, noisy disparity values in the low-scaled level are taken indiscriminately to carry out the upsampling assignment, which could lead to dramatically weakened results. To solve this problem, we herein present a Markov random field (MRF) based disparity upsampling method using confidence evaluations. We utilize confidence measures under the stereo configuration to evaluate the reliability of disparity value. The confidence maps are then properly integrated into the state-of-the-art MRF-based depth upsampling (MBU) method to constrain the negative effect caused by the noisy disparity. More specifically, the confidence is used to remove unqualified pixels from participating in the disparity upsampling computation. Extensive experiments were performed to validate the proposed new method. In these experiments, initial low-scaled disparity maps were from either ground truth or stereo matching methods. Results verified that our method can obtain significantly better upsampled disparity maps than that from the original MBU or other nonconfidence-based methods. In addition, we implemented our algorithms on general public utilities to improve the execution speed.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2017.2787727","National High-tech R&D Program (863 Program) of China(grant numbers:2015AA015905); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61605240); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8240719","Confidence evaluation;disparity upsampling;markov random field (MRF);noise;three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction","Noise measurement;Color;Three-dimensional displays;Mathematical model;Image color analysis;Reliability;Graphics processing units","","2","","36","IEEE","27 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the environmental conditions can distort the emitted signals and complicate the ranging process. In this context, the selection of proper acoustic signals can facilitate the attainment of this goal and improve the localization accuracy. This letter deals with the design and evaluation of acoustic probe signals allowing the implementation of ranging applications using unsynchronized audio signals acquired by different network nodes.

However, since the network is trained by minimizing the perceptual loss, the GAN based SISR method (SRGAN) [1] results in images with very low objective quality, i.e., peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). In this letter, we aim to solve this problem in an image style transfer way, to generate an image with similar perceptual quality as SRGAN, but with much higher objective quality. Moreover, we propose a threshold-based method to automatically alter the objective and perceptual quality of the reconstructed image through adjusting only one parameter. Experimental results show that our method can achieve more than 1.6 dB PSNR improvement over SRGAN with similar Mean Opinion Score value. Also, with the same objective quality, our method can provide significantly better perceptual results than other state-of-the-art SISR methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2805809","Imperial CSC scholarship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8290957","Image quality;single image super-resolution (SISR);style transfer","Image resolution;Image quality;Image reconstruction;Signal resolution;Signal processing algorithms;Image restoration;Neural networks","","42","","33","IEEE","13 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since it is impossible to resolve the frequency ambiguity using a single sub-Nyquist sample sequence, an additional sampling channel is used to determine the correct frequencies. First, a time-staggered sampling system, with the staggered time less than or equal to the Nyquist sampling interval, is proposed. This approach requires only 3K samples to estimate the K frequency components in the signal. However, aliasing can occur when the differences between some frequencies are integer multiples of the sampling rate. Then, another sampling strategy that makes use of feedback is proposed to prevent aliasing. We demonstrate that using two sampling channels and with feedback, 4K samples suffice to resolve both frequency ambiguity and image frequency aliasing. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed systems.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2813321","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671177,61102148); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8309363","Feedback;multiple sinusoids;Prony's method;sub-Nyquist sampling;time staggered","Frequency estimation;Time-frequency analysis;Frequency modulation;Estimation;Signal resolution;Simulation;Indexes","","25","","25","IEEE","8 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using the definitions of DPCIR and UBCIR, we show that the SLP power minimization problem, minimizing either sum or peak (per-antenna) transmit power, can always be formulated as a convex optimization problem.

In this letter, we propose a deterministic sensing matrix for collecting measurements fed into sparse fast Fourier transform (sFFT) as the decoder. Compared with the conventional paradigm with Gaussian random matrix at encoder and convex programming or greedy method at decoders, sFFT can reconstruct sparse signals with very low computation cost under the comparable number of measurements. But, the limitation is that the signal must be sparse in the frequency domain. We further show how to relax this limitation into any domains with the transformation matrix or dictionary being circulant. Experimental and theoretical results validate that the proposed method achieves fast sensing, fast recovery, and low memory cost.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2809693","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8302955","Compressive sensing (CS);sensing matrix;sparse fast Fourier transform (sFFT);sparsity","Sensors;Sparse matrices;Decoding;Dictionaries;Frequency-domain analysis;Encoding;Hardware","","12","","26","IEEE","26 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
