Under the Gauss-Markov model assumptions, data fusion based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is the minimum variance unbiased estimator. Nonetheless, we propose a linear fusion algorithm based on the random matrix theory, which yields a biased estimator. The proposed estimator has a lower mean squared error (MSE) than the MLE fusion method when the dimensionality of signal is larger than the number of sensors, which is the typical use case in modern fusion systems. The fusion coefficients are directly solved in the proposed method without iteration, and this method can be considered as an approximate implementation of the linear minimum MSE (LMMSE) estimator.

By adding a buffer to censored distributed wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the uncensored data can be modeled as a queue. With the buffer, the new algorithm entails simple, closed-form updates, and has no loss in terms of estimation accuracy comparing to the original AC method. The proposed model can further reduce the communication cost of distributed WSNs. The proposed model is illustrated in a linear regression setting.

Then, we propose to enhance LGP by encoding pixels’ intensity information. This is achieved by sorting image pixels into two categories via a dominant intensity order measure, followed by extracting LGP features over the categorized pixels. As a result, local gradient information and global intensity order information are both encoded into our descriptor in a way that is robust to grayscale-inversion and rotation changes.

One fundamental problem in GSP is sampling-from which subset of graph nodes to collect samples in order to reconstruct a bandlimited graph signal in high fidelity. In this letter, we seek a sampling strategy that minimizes the mean square error (MSE) of the reconstructed bandlimited graph signals assuming an independent and identically distributed noise model-leading naturally to the A-optimal design criterion. To avoid matrix inversion, we first prove that the inverse of the information matrix in the A-optimal criterion is equivalent to a Neumann matrix series. We then transform the truncated Neumann series-based sampling problem into an equivalent expression that replaces eigenvectors of the Laplacian operator with a submatrix of an ideal low-pass graph filter. Finally, we approximate the ideal filter using a Chebyshev matrix polynomial. We design a greedy algorithm to iteratively minimize the simplified objective. For signal reconstruction, we propose an accompanied signal reconstruction strategy that reuses the approximated filter submatrix and is provably more robust than conventional least square recovery. Simulation results show that our sampling strategy outperforms two previous strategies in MSE performance at comparable complexity.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2818062","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771356); 111 project of China(grant numbers:B08038); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8323179","Graph signal processing (GSP);optimal design;sampling","Complexity theory;Signal reconstruction;Chebyshev approximation;Robustness;Kernel;Transforms","","24","","24","IEEE","23 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, common techniques, like strided pooling and convolutional operations, are not directly applicable to SR due to severe image detail losses. In this letter, we circumvent this issue by proposing a new network architecture, namely the information-compensated (IC) downsampling block. It first uses pooling layers to downsample input feature maps and then immediately upsamples the feature maps back to the original size. To further compensate for information loss, skip connections are added to propagate lost features caused by downsampling to the upsampled output. In addition, pixelwise recurrent units are also applied to the downsampled feature maps to model context coherence. Compared with traditional pooling layers, the IC downsampling blocks cannot only enlarge receptive field and better capture image context, but also preserve image details, which are essential to SR. The final network consists of a stack of IC downsampling blocks and can be trained in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results verify that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2817612","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61471082,61671103); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8320806","Information-compensated downsampling;pixel LSTM;receptive field;super-resolution","Integrated circuits;Convolution;Image reconstruction;Encoding;Training;Logic gates;Context modeling","","17","","40","IEEE","21 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The teacher, which aims to provide the student with additional knowledge, employs auxiliary features (e.g., articulatory features or spectra of short-time Fourier transform) in addition to the conventional input and output of acoustic models. The student, which serves as the final acoustic model for synthesis, adopts a multitask learning architecture which uses the outcome of the teacher as the target of its secondary task.

Local TV methods fail to preserve texture details and often create additional artifacts due to over-smoothing. Nonlocal TV (NLTV) methods have been proposed as a solution to this but they either lack continuous updates due to computational constraints or limit the locality to a small region. In this letter, we propose adaptive graph-based TV. The proposed method goes beyond spatial similarity between different regions of an image being reconstructed by establishing a connection between similar regions in the entire image regardless of spatial distance. As compared to NLTV, the proposed method is computationally efficient and involves updating the graph prior during every iteration making the connection between similar regions stronger. Moreover, it promotes sparsity in the wavelet and graph gradient domains. Since TV is a special case of graph TV, the proposed method can also be seen as a generalization of SER and TV methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2816582","Japanese Government OIST Subsidy for Operations(grant numbers:5020S7010020); OIST PhD Fellowship; Swiss National Science Foundation(grant numbers:200021_154350/1); Japanese Government OIST Subsidy for Operations (Skoglund U.)(grant numbers:5020S7010020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8318649","Graphs;iterative image reconstruction;nonlocal total variation;tomography;total variation","Image reconstruction;TV;Signal processing algorithms;Subspace constraints;Computed tomography;Compressed sensing","","31","","43","OAPA","16 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this issue, we introduce two filtering processes in the reconstruction: 1) a reduced-randomized filter; and 2) an unbiased filter. The reconstruction examples demonstrate that such filtering processes effectively reduce the error.

However, the conventional least squares (LS) turbo channel estimation technique based on the maximum likelihood approach is difficult to be performed in large MU-MIMO systems since it requires a cubic complexity order O(κ3 NT3 NR3) for a system constant κ and numbers of NT-transmit and NR-receive antennas. This is because the conventional technique computes inversion of a covariance matrix whose size is proportional to κNT NR. We propose a new low-complexity LS estimation technique that requires a complexity order O(κ3 NT3) only by utilizing algebraic property on the covariance matrix.

In this letter, we propose a novel method that allows gradient-based and deep-learning-based methods to jointly learn both the matrix factorization model and a discretization operator. By introducing a loss function that accounts for the reconstruction error with respect to the discrete predictions, we obtain a discrete matrix completion algorithm with high reconstruction accuracy.
