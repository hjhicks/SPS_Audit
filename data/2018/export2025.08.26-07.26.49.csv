Instead of using one bit per node of the tree, the context allows for deriving probabilities for that node based on distances of the actual voxel to the voxels in a reference point cloud. Accurate probabilities of the node state allow for the use of an arithmetic coder to reduce the bit rate.

On Analysis of Active Querying for Recursive State Estimation,A. Koçanaoğulları; D. Erdoğmuş; M. Akçakaya,"Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA; Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA; University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, Pennsylvania",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,24 Apr 2018,2018,25,6,743,747,"In stochastic linear/nonlinear active dynamic systems, states are estimated with the evidence through recursive measurements in response to queries of the system about the state to be estimated. Therefore, query selection is essential for such systems to improve state estimation accuracy and time. Query selection is conventionally achieved by minimization of the evidence variance or optimization of various information theoretic objectives. It was shown that optimization of mutual information-based objectives and variance-based objectives arrive at the same solution. However, existing approaches optimize approximations to the intended objectives rather than solving the exact optimization problems. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose an active querying procedure using mutual information maximization in recursive state estimation. First we show that mutual information generalizes variance based query selection methods and show the equivalence between objectives if the evidence likelihoods have unimodal distributions. We then solve the exact optimization problem for query selection and propose a query (measurement) selection algorithm. We specifically formulate the mutual information maximization for query selection as a combinatorial optimization problem and show that the objective is submodular, therefore can be solved efficiently with guaranteed convergence bounds through a greedy approach. Additionally, we analyze the performance of the query selection algorithm by testing it through a brain computer interface (BCI) typing system.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2018.2823271,"National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1149570,CNS-1544895,IIS-1715858); Department of Health and Human Services(grant numbers:90RE5017-02-01); National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:R01DC009834); NSF(grant numbers:IIS-1717654); Air Force Office of Scientific Research; Dynamic Data-Driven Applications Systems Program(grant numbers:FA9550-16-1-0386); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8331916,Active querying;mutual information;query selection;recursive state estimation,Optimization;State estimation;Mutual information;Entropy;Stochastic processes;Minimization;Signal processing algorithms,,7,,26,IEEE,5 Apr 2018,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

To accomplish this, a high-speed vision system is required to track fabric motions and recognize repetitive weave patterns with high accuracy, from a microperspective near a sewing zone. In this letter, we present an innovative framework for real-time texture tracking and weave pattern recognition. Our framework includes a module for motion estimation using blob detection and feature matching. It also includes a module for lattice detection to facilitate the weave pattern recognition. Our lattice-detection algorithm utilizes blob detection and template matching to assess pair-wise similarity in blobs' appearance. In addition, it extracts information of dominant orientations to obtain a global constraint in the topology. By incorporating both constraints in the appearance similarity and the global topology, the algorithm determines a lattice that characterizes the topological structure of the repetitive weave pattern, thus allowing for thread counting. In our experiments, the proposed thread-based texture tracking system is capable of tracking denim fabric with high accuracy (e.g., 0.03° rotation and 0.02 weave-thread translation errors) and high speed (3 frames per second), demonstrating its high potential for automatic real-time textile manufacturing.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2018.2825309,"Walmart Foundation(grant numbers:1806K45); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8334635,Lattice detection;pattern recognition;texture tracking;texture regularity;thread counting,Lattices;Fabrics;Feature extraction;Yarn;Tracking;Weaving;Machine vision,,10,,21,IEEE,10 Apr 2018,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

However, using only few CSP features, though alleviates overfitting problem, loses the discriminating information, which limits the BCI performance.

Multitask deep learning is one of the approach to improve age estimation by employing auxiliary tasks, such as gender recognition, that are related to the primary task. However, in traditional multitask learning for age estimation, the relationship between the primary and auxiliary tasks is difficult to describe; how the auxiliary tasks enhance the model for the primary objective is ambiguous. In this letter, we propose a conditional multitask learning method that architecturally factorizes an age variable into gender-conditioned age probabilities in a deep neural network. The lack of accurate training labels with discrete age values is another critical limitation to training age estimation models. Therefore, we propose a label expansion method that increases the number of accurate labels from weakly supervised categorical labels. To verify the generality of the proposed method, we perform intensive experiments on the publicly available MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets.

Toward the end, we rely on an empirical model for the joint statistics of motion and depth subband coefficients of an S3-D video frame. Specifically, we use the recently proposed bivariate generalized Gaussian distribution (BGGD) model for the joint statistics. In this letter, we show that the coherence of the covariance matrix of the BGGD varies in proportion with the perceptual video quality. We compute the coherence scores from the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix to estimate the amount of directional dependency between the motion and depth components. To estimate the overall spatial quality score, we apply off-the-shelf 2-D FR image quality assessment metrics on a frame-by-frame basis on both the views and average the frame wise scores. Finally, we pool the coherence and spatial quality scores to derive the overall quality for the S3-D video. An evaluation of the proposed algorithm on the IRCCYN, WaterlooIVC Phase I, and LFOVIA S3D video databases demonstrates its robust performance.

In this letter, we propose a novel global temporal representation named optical-flow stacked difference image (OFSDI) and extract robust and discriminative feature from the infrared action data by considering the local, global, and spatial temporal information together. Due to the small size of the infrared action dataset, we first apply convolutional neural networks on local, spatial, and global temporal stream respectively to obtain efficient convolutional feature maps from the raw data rather than train a classifier directly. Then these convolutional feature maps are aggregated into effective descriptors named three-stream trajectory-pooled deep-convolutional descriptors by trajectory-constrained pooling. Furthermore, we improve the robustness of these features by using the locality-constrained linear coding (LLC) method. With these features, a linear support vector machine (SVM) is adopted to classify the action data in our scheme.

It is very challenging since rich plant leaf morphological variations, such as sizes, textures, shapes, venation, and so on. Most existing plant leaf methods typically normalize all plant leaf images to the same size and recognize them at one scale, resulting in unsatisfactory performances. In this letter, a multiscale fusion convolutional neural network (MSF-CNN) is proposed for plant leaf recognition at multiple scales. First, an input image is down-sampled into multiples low resolution images with a list of bilinear interpolation operations. Then, these input images with different scales are step-by-step fed into the MSF-CNN architecture to learn discriminative features at different depths. At this stage, the feature fusion between two different scales is realized by a concatenation operation, which concatenates feature maps learned on different scale images from a channel view. Along with the depth of the MSF-CNN, multiscale images are progressively handled and the corresponding features are fused. Third, the last layer of the MSF-CNN aggregates all discriminative information to obtain the final feature for predicting the plant species of the input image.

However, the coherence interval of the covariance matrices is larger than that of the channel vectors.

In this letter, we propose a method for color-correcting underwater images, utilizing a framework of gray information estimation for color constancy. The key novelty of our method is to utilize exposure-bracketing imaging: a technique to capture multiple images with different exposure times for color correction. The long-exposure image is useful for sufficiently acquiring red spectrum information of underwater scenes. In contrast, pixel values in the green and blue channels in the short-exposure image are suitable because they are unlikely to attenuate more than the red ones. By selecting appropriate images (i.e., least over- and under-exposed images) for each color channel from those taken with exposure-bracketing imaging, we fuse an image that includes sufficient spectral information of underwater scenes. The fused image allows us to extract reliable gray information of scenes; thus, effective color corrections can be achieved. We perform color correction by linear regression of gray information estimated from the fused image.
