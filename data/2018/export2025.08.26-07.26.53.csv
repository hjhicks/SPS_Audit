Specifically, we estimate the mean, power spectrum, and bispectrum of the signal from the observations. Since the bispectrum contains the phase information of the signal, reliable algorithms for bispectrum inversion are useful in many applications. We propose a new algorithm using spectral decomposition of the bispectrum phase matrix for this task. For clean signals, we show that the eigenvectors of the bispectrum phase matrix correspond to the true phases of the signal and its shifted copies. In addition, the spectral method is robust to noise. It can be used as a stable and efficient initialization technique for local nonconvex optimization for bispectrum inversion.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2831631","UIUC COE SRI grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8352518","","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Signal processing algorithms;Noise measurement;Estimation;Discrete Fourier transforms;Robustness;Computational complexity","","15","","28","IEEE","30 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, we present a novel multiconnected convolutional network for SISR tasks by enhancing the combination of both low- and high-level features. We design a structure built on multiconnected blocks to extract diversified and complicated features via the concatenation of low-level features to high-level features. In addition to stacking multiconnected blocks, a long skip-connection is implemented to further aggregate features of the first layer and a specific later layer. Furthermore, we employ a flexible two-parameter loss function to optimize the training process.

For the remaining transmission period, the switch is on such that the uplink transmission takes place simultaneously with the downlink transmission. A novel energy-efficiency maximization problem is formulated for the joint design of downlink beamformers, uplink power allocations, and the transmission time-splitting factor.

In this letter, we propose to generalize TV regularization by replacing the 11 -penalty with an alternative prior that is trainable. Specifically, our method learns the prior via extending the recently proposed fast parallel proximal algorithm to incorporate data-adaptive proximal operators. The proposed framework does not require additional inner iterations for evaluating the proximal mappings of the corresponding learned prior.

Observability of a high dimensional system state may require a large number of measurements in general, but we show that if the initial state vector admits a sparse representation, the number of measurements can be significantly reduced by using random projections for obtaining the measurements. We derive guarantees for the observability of the system using tools from probability theory and compressed sensing. Our analysis uses properties of the transfer matrix and random measurement matrices to derive concentration of measure bounds, which lead to sufficient conditions for the restricted isometry property of the observability matrix to hold. Hence, under the derived conditions, the initial state can be recovered by solving a computationally tractable convex optimization problem.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2830966","Ministry of Information Technology, Government of India; Intel India PhD fellowship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8354720","Compressive sensing;linear dynamical systems;observability;restricted isometry property","Observability;Sparse matrices;Pollution measurement;Mathematical model;Compressed sensing;Linear systems;Random variables","","8","","30","IEEE","4 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this issue, a novel densely connected DCFs framework is proposed for visual tracking. We incorporate multiple nested DCFs into the deep learning architecture, and then train the compact network with the data-specific target. Specifically, feature maps and interim response maps are shared and reused throughout the whole network. By doing so, the implicit information carried out by each DCF is fully exploited to enhance the model representation ability during the tracking process.

While the adaptation of the location (mean) of the proposals has been largely studied, an important challenge of AIS relates to the difficulty of adapting the scale parameter (covariance matrix). In the case of weight degeneracy, adapting the covariance matrix using the empirical covariance results in a singular matrix, which leads to a poor performance in subsequent iterations of the algorithm.

The motivation behind this letter is to take samples gradually from simple to complex into consideration during training, which is similar to the mechanism of knowledge acquisition for humans. Under the unsupervised learning framework constructed on the autoencoder infrastructure, our SPAE first learns a weak autoencoder via samples with small losses and, then, elevates itself to a relatively strong autoencoder through samples with large losses. Then, the SPAE is generalized to a temporal domain, resulting to temporal SPAE (TSPAE), where the temporal information is explored and exploited to improve the performance.

Results validated the effectiveness of our proposed method and its superiority over many previous studies.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2843281","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61501033); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2017RC02); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8370674","Incremental learning;matrix sketching;semisupervised classification","Neural networks;Feature extraction;Data models;Matrix decomposition;Support vector machines;Clustering methods;Adaptation models","","13","1","28","IEEE","1 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Binary feature extraction algorithms, however, tend to have poor mirror invariance, and search algorithms that match binary features have a lower inlier ratio. To address these issues, we employ a scale space pyramid to simulate human eye imaging and then detect FAST (FAST feature detector) points at each level in the pyramid and calculate the FAST point feature's orientation with an image intensity centroid. We propose circumferential binary string mirror invariance rules and a circumferential binary feature (CBF) extraction algorithm to enhance the mirror invariance of binary features, and a fast calculate bitmap (FCBM) algorithm and bitmap local sensitive hash (BMLSH) to improve the inlier ratio of matching binary features. Experiments show that the CBF performs well in mirror invariance and has stronger adaptability and that BMLSH searches inliers more efficiently.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2820645","“Core electronic devices, high-end generic chips, and basic software” national science and technology major projects(grant numbers:2017ZX01030-201); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8327483","Adaptability;bitmap local sensitive hash;circumferential binary feature;mirror invariance","Mirrors;Feature extraction;Signal processing algorithms;Interpolation;Indexes;Clustering algorithms;Image retrieval","","1","","16","IEEE","28 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using the determined constant, the scene albedo can be recovered, eliminating the haze from single hazy images. The proposed GDM is able to suppress the halo/blocking artifacts in the recovered results due to the scene albedo, which is less sensitive to the determined constant.

Then, a novel constrained radial agglomerative clustering algorithm is proposed to divide the remaining images, so that each image cluster could be independently added to the base model in parallel. Finally, all the partial models are merged into a complete scene.

However, because the model treats the tracker's predictions in new frames as training data, the filter can be contaminated by small incorrect predictions, which cause model drift. Particle-filter-based trackers usually produce more accurate results due to the richer image representations used in prediction, but suffer when the environments are complex throughout an image sequence. In this letter, we propose an innovative real-time algorithm, which combines the particle filter with correlation filters in the prediction stage, enabling accurate predictions by the particle filter and alleviating model drift. Moreover, an effective decision fusion strategy is proposed to get more precise object predictions, thus further enhancing the overall tracking performance. Extensive evaluations on the OTB-2013 benchmark demonstrate that the proposed tracker is very promising compared with the state-of-the-art trackers, while operating over 85 frames/s.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2843524","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61501048); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:4182042); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2017RC12); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1536111,U1536112); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8371210","Correlation filter;decision fusion;particle filter;real time;visual tracking","Correlation;Visualization;Target tracking;Acceleration;Computational modeling;Real-time systems","","8","","39","IEEE","4 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, reversible authentication (RA) schemes, which do not lead to the introduction of distortion, have become increasingly popular. However, existing RA schemes need the help of third-party services for tamper localization or content recovery, and hence are not completely blind, which may result in inconvenience and insecurity of the authentication procedure. Motivated by this issue, a new RA scheme is proposed using the prediction-error expansion and compressed sensing reconstruction techniques. The proposed scheme achieves basic authentication in a reversible way, and implements tamper localization and content recovery without any third-party dependency. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed scheme has better performance compared to other state-of-the-art RA schemes.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2844562","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61662039,61362032,61762055,61462048); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province(grant numbers:20171BAB202004,20161BAB202036); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8373686","Blind reversible authentication (RA);content recovery;tamper detection","Watermarking;Authentication;Distortion;Discrete cosine transforms;Image reconstruction;Image restoration;Intellectual property","","14","","14","IEEE","6 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For moderate to high signal-to-noise ratios the estimator works effectively even for short length observations. Unlike the conventional methods that use a covariance matrix, the proposed estimator makes use of a three-way covariance tensor formed from the one-dimensional data. Estimate of the model order has been determined by processing the incremental Frobenius norms of the leading principal subtensors of the core tensor obtained via higher order singular value decomposition. Simulations under additive white Gaussian noise show that the new estimator offers significant improvements over conventional methods such as multiple signal classification (MUSIC), estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance technique+maximum a posteriori, and entropy-based MUSIC. The improvement is particularly notable at larger orders or when frequency separation is small.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2845682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8375670","Covariance tensor;high-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD);multiple signal classification (MUSIC);order estimation","Tensile stress;Estimation;Signal to noise ratio;Covariance matrices;Multiple signal classification;AWGN;Singular value decomposition","","5","","16","IEEE","8 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The KDRN is built on multiple kernel ridge regressions (KRR) hierarchically, where each is trained analytically and independently. In principal, KDRN does not mean to learn directly from the raw touch-stroke data like other deep learning models, but it relearns from the pre-extracted features to yield a richer and a relatively more discriminative feature set. Subsequent to that, the authentication is carried out by KRR. Overall, KDRN achieves an equal error rate of 0.013% for intrasession authentication, 0.023% for intersession authentication, and 0.121% for interweek authentication on the Touchlaytics dataset.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2846050","National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning(grant numbers:2016R1A2B4011656); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8378259","Authentication;biometrics;stacking-based deep neural network;touch-stroke dynamics","Authentication;Kernel;Training;Feature extraction;Biometrics (access control);Machine learning;Hidden Markov models","","14","","19","IEEE","11 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
