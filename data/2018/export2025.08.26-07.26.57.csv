In this letter, we exploit a continuous mixed norm (CMN) for robust sparse recovery instead of ℓp-norm. We show that in blind conditions, i.e., in the case where the parameters of the noise distribution are unknown, incorporating CMN can lead to near-optimal recovery. We apply alternating direction method of multipliers for solving the problem induced by utilizing CMN for robust sparse recovery. In this approach, CMN is replaced with a surrogate function and the majorization-minimization technique is incorporated to solve the problem.

To generate a condensed video, moving objects (a.k.a. object tubes) in the video are rearranged in the temporal domain using a predefined objective function. The objective function consists of several energy terms which play important roles in making a visually appealing condensed video. One of the energy terms, collision energy, creates a bottleneck in the computation because it requires two object tubes to calculate the degree of collision between them. Existing approaches try to reduce the computation time of the collision energy calculation by reducing the number of tubes processed at once. However, those approaches are not sufficient to generate condensed video when the number of object tubes becomes large. In this letter, we propose a fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based parallelized tube rearrangement algorithm. To take advantage of both parallel processing and FFT, we represent object tubes as three-dimensional binary matrices (occupation matrices). An objective function of the tube rearrangement problem is defined on the occupation matrix, and a starting position for each tube in the temporal domain is then determined by optimizing the objective function. Throughout the experiments, the proposed algorithm took a much shorter time to condense the video than existing algorithms, while other performance metrics were similar.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2848842","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8387811","Fast Fourier transform (FFT);online video synopsis;parallel processing;tube rearrangement;video surveillance","Electron tubes;Signal processing algorithms;Optimization;Linear programming;Parallel processing;Fast Fourier transforms;Three-dimensional displays","","14","","24","IEEE","18 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The synchronization process is initiated by the cluster head and includes three steps: 1) threshold-based intracluster time synchronization (TITS); 2) forwarding-based intercluster time synchronization (FITS); and 3) one-way intracluster time synchronization (OITS). Specifically, first, TITS achieves the logical clock of cluster head to be synchronized to the largest logical clock of intracluster nodes with three times point-to-point message exchange in two cycles. Especially, by comparing the logical skew of each intracluster node with the logical skew of cluster head, member nodes with smaller logical skew will not reply to cluster head to reduce the number of message exchanges. Then, in FITS, the cluster heads synchronize with each other and the message exchanges of cluster heads are realized through the message forwarding of the gateway nodes. At last, OITS utilizes the one-way communication to synchronize all the intracluster nodes with cluster head via two times broadcasting of cluster head. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can reduce the communication traffic greatly and improve the convergence rate.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2847231","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61701065); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8383944","Cluster;consensus;time synchronization;wireless sensor networks (WSNs)","Synchronization;Clocks;Wireless sensor networks;Logic gates;Protocols;Clustering algorithms;Magnetic heads","","29","","13","IEEE","13 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compressive K-Means (CKM) is such a method: It aims at estimating the centroids of data clusters from pooled, nonlinear, and random signatures of the learning examples. While this approach significantly reduces computational time on very large datasets, its digital implementation wastes acquisition resources because the learning examples are compressed only after the sensing stage. The present work generalizes the CKM sketching procedure to a large class of periodic nonlinearities including hardware-friendly implementations that compressively acquire entire datasets. This idea is exemplified in a quantized CKM procedure, a variant of CKM that leverages 1-bit universal quantization (i.e., retaining the least significant bit of a standard uniform quantizer) as the periodic sketch nonlinearity. Trading for this resource-efficient signature (standard in most acquisition schemes) has almost no impact on the clustering performance, as illustrated by numerical experiments.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2847908","Belgian National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8386678","1-bit universal quantization, compressed sensing, compressive learning, k-means clustering","Probability density function;Measurement;Quantization (signal);Optimization;Kernel;Clustering algorithms;Sensors","","15","","36","IEEE","15 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although a deep learning framework that estimates the time-frequency (T-F) domain ideal ratio masks demonstrates a strong performance, it is limited in the sense that the enhancement process is performed only in the magnitude domain, while the phase spectra remain unchanged. Thus, recent studies have been conducted to involve phase spectra in speech enhancement systems. A phase-sensitive mask (PSM) is a T-F mask that implicitly represents phase-related information. However, since the PSM has an unbounded value, the networks are trained to target its truncated values rather than directly estimating it. To effectively train the PSM, we first approximate it to have a bounded dynamic range under the assumption that speech and noise are uncorrelated. We then propose a joint learning algorithm that trains the approximated value through its parameterized variables in order to minimize the inevitable error caused by the truncation process. Specifically, we design a network that explicitly targets three parameterized variables: 1) speech magnitude spectra; 2) noise magnitude spectra; and 3) phase difference of clean to noisy spectra. To further improve the performance, we also investigate how the dynamic range of magnitude spectra controlled by a warping function affects the final performance in joint learning algorithms. Finally, we examined how the proposed additional constraint that preserves the sum of the estimated speech and noise power spectra affects the overall system performance. The experimental results show that the proposed learning algorithm outperforms the conventional learning algorithm with the truncated phase-sensitive approximation.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2849578","Google Inc.; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8392411","Phase-sensitive objective function;joint learning;single-channel speech enhancement","Speech enhancement;Noise measurement;Signal processing algorithms;Approximation algorithms;Linear programming;Dynamic range;Estimation","","29","","22","IEEE","21 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
