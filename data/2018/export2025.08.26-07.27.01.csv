This letter is committed to the joint frequency and direction-of-arrival estimation of more sources than sensors in a subband by using sparse arrays with sub-Nyquist sampling. The newly defined block vectorization eliminates the interference from sub-Nyquist sampling. Based on this, a novel augmented sample covariance matrix method is proposed, which enhances the spatial degrees of freedom and increases the number of identifiable sources. Simulations show that the joint estimation can be realized at a lower sampling rate with fewer sensors at the expense of a degradation in estimation performance. Such an algorithm provides a tradeoff between the expensive resource of sensors and channels, and the estimation performance.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2848838","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8387904","Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation;frequency estimation;sparse array;sub-Nyquist sampling","Sensor arrays;Covariance matrices;Estimation;Signal processing algorithms;IP networks;Direction-of-arrival estimation","","27","","15","IEEE","18 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Developing efficient SAD systems in highly naturalist data scenarios is a challenge. In this study, we investigate the SAD problem on NASAs Apollo space mission data [1]. Apollo data consists of long-term naturalistic audio recordings (i.e., 6-12 day missions). The Apollo data poses various challenges like: 1) noise distortion with variable SNR, 2) channel distortion, 3) very high density of speech, 4) foreground versus background speech, and 5) extended periods of nonspeech activity. In this study, we use threshold optimized combo-SAD [21] as our baseline unsupervised system. This technique was developed to address variable speech/nonspeech density issues in long-term audio data. To mitigate issues related to Apollo audio loops, multispeaker scenarios including foreground versus background conversations within loops, and highly noisy background, a new curriculum learning (CL) based convolutional neural network (CNN) model is developed. This efficient method leverages the long-term learning capability of CNN and CL strategies where data are trained in a manner that improves the efficiency during the learning process. Here, we use signal-to-noise ratio as the learning parameter. Our experiments on free flowing Apollo audio data show that the proposed approach provides a significant improvement in SAD performance (> 10%).","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2841653","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1219130); Air Force Research Laboratory(grant numbers:FA8750-15-1-0205); University of Texas at Dallas from the Distinguished University Chair in Telecommunications Engineering; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8368146","Apollo mission audio;curriculum learning (CL);convolutional neural networks (CNNs);speech activity detection (SAD)","NASA;Signal to noise ratio;Feature extraction;Data models;Voice activity detection;Distortion;Convolutional neural networks","","6","","32","IEEE","28 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When extended to graph signal processing (GSP), this would mean that a shift-invariant graph filter can be represented as a polynomial of the shift matrix of the graph. Prior work shows that this holds under the shift-enabled condition that the characteristic and minimum polynomials of the shift matrix are identical. While the shift-enabled condition is often ignored in the literature, this letter shows that this condition is essential for the following reasons. First, we prove that this condition is not just sufficient but also necessary for any shift-invariant filter to be representable by the shift matrix. Moreover, we provide a counterexample showing that given a filter that commutes with a non-shift-enabled graph, it is generally impossible to convert the graph into a shift-enabled graph with a shift matrix still commuting with the original filter. The result provides a deeper understanding of shift-invariant filters when applied in GSP and shows that further investigation of shift-enabled graphs is needed to make them applicable to practical scenarios.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2849685","European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska–Curie(grant numbers:734331); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:0800219369); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8392705","Digital signal processing;graph signal processing;polynomial;shift-invariant filter","Digital signal processing;Matrix converters;Symmetric matrices;Laplace equations;Computer science;Electronic mail","","14","","15","IEEE","22 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, we propose an audio-visual matching network to learn the correspondence between voice fluctuations and lip movements. We then propose a framework to apply this network to address the source permutation problem and improve over audio-only speech separation methods. The modular design of this framework makes it easy to apply the matching network to any audio-only speech separation method. Experiments on two-talker mixtures show that the proposed approach significantly improves the separation quality over the state-of-the-art audio-only method.

As it is often difficult to estimate the source-sensor range from individual nodes, the source positions have to be inferred from the direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimates. Due to reverberation and noise, the sound field becomes increasingly diffuse with increasing source-sensor distance, leading to a decreased Direction of Arrival (DoA)-estimation accuracy. To distinguish between accurate and uncertain DoA estimates, this letter proposes to incorporate the coherent-to-diffuse ratio as a measure of DoA reliability for single-source tracking.

However, the presence of some peaks in Fourier domain and low-frequency defects that are shared among cameras due to the same or comparable in-camera processing strategies leads to increasing the false acceptance rate. In this way, it is important to eliminate these undesirable artifacts to enhance the exactness and reliability. In this letter, we have developed a method for preprocessing the camera reference pattern noise (RPN). This letter is motivated by the fact that refraction of light on dust particle and optical surface affect the major part of camera-RPN. These components are combined and termed as “doughnut” patterns. They are of low frequency in nature. As these low-frequency defects are not characteristic of the sensor, hence they should be removed from the estimated camera-RPN. To achieve this, the proposed method first uses the widely accepted spectrum-equalization algorithm (SEA) to find and suppress the peaks present in the camera-RPN and then eliminates the low-frequency defects in the discrete cosine transform domain. Experimental results performed on the freely available “Dresden” image database show that the proposed method is able to improve the efficiency of the SEA methods, as well as this combination is able to work far better than the other camera-RPN enhancement techniques.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2857223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8412553","Digital image forensic (DIF);photo response nonuniformity (PRNU);source-camera identification (SCI);sensor pattern noise (SPN);spectrum-equalization algorithm (SEA)","Cameras;Discrete cosine transforms;Digital images;Image databases;Task analysis;Estimation;Forensics","","13","","14","IEEE","18 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

More specifically, we cast frontal face synthesis as the encoder-disentangling-decoder process of profile faces, and a salient feature of our DSN is that a pair of images with arbitrary identities, poses, and illuminations is used as the input rather than a single image used in many existing works. The process consists of the following three stages:  1)First, the representations of a pair of face images are learned by the Siamese encoder module. 2)Then, the interpretable representations are disentangled into the identity, pose, and illumination representations separately. 3)Finally, the identity representation is transferred into the frontal face image using the decoder module.  The proposed network is evaluated on the face recognition and synthesis problem.

A despeckling residual neural network (DRNN) is trained with an adversarial loss imposed by a discriminator. The discriminator tries to differentiate between the despeckled images generated by the DRNN and the set of high-quality images. Further to prevent the developed network from oversmoothing, a structural loss term is used along with the adversarial loss.

The affinity matrix plays a significant role in exploiting the manifold structures of visual feature space, hence we propose to use the LRR to guide the affinity-matrix construction by exploring the subspace structures of data. Considering the locality and similarity information among data, we incorporate a Laplacian regularization term to the LRR framework to ensure that the learned affinity matrix can capture the local geometric structures in data. We also explicitly impose the nonnegative sparse constraint on the affinity matrix to facilitate the learning of local manifold structures. Moreover, we use an effective manifold-regularization methodology to learn discriminative semantic representations of test instances, leading to significant improvements in classification performance over the unseen classes.

The distributed nature of these problems calls for methods that are, themselves, distributed. While most collaborative learning problems require agents to reach a common (or consensus) model, there are situations in which the consensus solution may not be optimal. For instance, agents may want to reach a compromise between agreeing with their neighbors and minimizing a personal loss function. We present DJAM, a Jacobi-like distributed algorithm for learning personalized models. This method is implementation-friendly: it has no hyperparameters that need tuning, it is asynchronous, and its updates only require single-neighbor interactions. We prove that DJAM converges with probability one to the solution, provided that the personal loss functions are strongly convex and have Lipschitz gradient. We then give evidence that DJAM is on par with state-of-the-art methods: our method reaches a solution with error similar to the error of a carefully tuned alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) in about the same number of single-neighbor interactions.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2859596","Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia, Portugal(grant numbers:UID/EEA/50009/2013,PD/BD/135012/2017); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8421017","Collaborative work;distributed algorithms;distributed computing;optimization","Signal processing algorithms;Convergence;Radio frequency;Jacobian matrices;Optimization;Distributed algorithms;Nickel","","6","","18","IEEE","26 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to quantify the classification performance with compressed data, we consider the Bhattacharya distance as the performance metric. In the presence of intra-signal correlation at a given sensor, the degradation in the Bhattacharya distance with compressed data is shown to be nonlinear with the compression ratio in contrast to the case when there is no intra-signal correlation.

Two convolutional neural networks are jointly designed for the task: first, the structural parallax synthesis network predicts the parallax details for the entire LF based on a set of anisotropic parallax features. These novel features can efficiently capture the high-frequency perspective components of a LF from noisy observations. Second, the view-dependent detail compensation network restores non-Lambertian variation to each LF view by involving view-specific spatial energies.

It is shown that “data-free” softmax model synthesis corresponds to solving a linear system of parameter equations, wherein desired dominant class log-odds boundaries are encoded via convex polytopes that decompose the input feature space. When solvable, the linear equations yield closed-form softmax parameter solution families using class boundary polytope specifications only. This allows softmax parameter learning to be implemented without expensive brute force data sampling and numerical optimization. The linear equations can also be adapted to constrained maximum likelihood estimation in data-sparse settings. Since solutions may also fail to exist for the linear parameter equations derived from certain polytope specifications, it is thus also shown that there exist probabilistic classification problems over m convexly separable classes for which the log-odds boundaries cannot be learned using an m-class softmax model.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2860238","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8421019","Classification algorithms;estimation;hybrid probabilistic models;neural networks;pattern recognition;probabilistic logic;supervised learning","Mathematical model;Training data;Probabilistic logic;Computational modeling;Data models;Parameter estimation;Estimation","","14","","21","IEEE","26 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Bernoulli-Gaussian (BG) distribution with sparsity-enforcing capability is imposed on the sparse signals. The sparsity degree in the BG model is positive and close to zero in the presence of the sparse signals and is zero in the absence of the signals. Motivated by this, the problem of detection of the sparse signals with a distributed sensor network is formulated as the problem of close and one-sided hypothesis testing on the sparsity degree. For this problem, we propose a detector based on the locally most powerful test (LMPT) to decide on the presence or absence of sparse signals with sensor networks. The proposed LMPT detector does not require signal recovery, which alleviates the complexity of the detection system in sensor networks. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed LMPT detector and corroborate our theoretical analysis.
