The SER performances are heavily dependent on the effectiveness of emotional features extracted from the speech. However, most emotional features are sensitive to emotionally irrelevant factors, such as the speaker, speaking styles, and environment. In this letter, we assume that calculating the deltas and delta-deltas for personalized features not only preserves the effective emotional information but also reduces the influence of emotionally irrelevant factors, leading to reduce misclassification. In addition, SER often suffers from the silent frames and emotionally irrelevant frames. Meanwhile, attention mechanism has exhibited outstanding performances in learning relevant feature representations for specific tasks. Inspired by this, we propose a three-dimensional attention-based convolutional recurrent neural networks to learn discriminative features for SER, where the Mel-spectrogram with deltas and delta-deltas are used as input.

For periodic states, the modulo- $T$ estimation error is of interest and the MSE lower bounds are inappropriate. Therefore, in this case, the mean-cyclic error and the MSE risks are used for estimation of the periodic and nonperiodic states, respectively. We derive a Bobrovsky-Zakai-type bound for mixed periodic and nonperiodic stochastic filtering. Then, we derive a recursive computation method for this bound in order to allow its computation in dynamic settings. The proposed recursively-computed mixed Bobrovsky–Zakai bound is useful for the design and performance analysis of filters in stochastic filtering problems with both periodic and nonperiodic states.

Due to an exponential increase in the number of GM components in such applications, Gaussian mixture reduction (GMR) approaches are deemed necessary. Traditionally, the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) is used for GMR along with a moment-matching merging approach to minimize the information loss. However, in certain applications such as image retrieval, preserving the geometric shape of the GM is more appealing. For such applications, this work prescribes the use of the Wasserstein distance (WD), which quantifies the minimum cost of converting one density into another and, therefore, is mostly concerned with the shape difference between the densities. To minimize the change in the shape of the GM, first, similar GM components are identified utilizing the WD. Next, these components are merged by proposing a novel WD-based averaging method. The simulation results confirm the success of the proposed WD-based GMR techniques in providing a better approximation of the original GM in the WD sense as compared to KLD-based methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2865829","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(grant numbers:PDF-487746-2016); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8440083","Gaussian mixture (GM);Gaussian mixture reduction (GMR);probabilistic distance approximation;Wasserstein distance (WD)","Shape;Probability density function;Probabilistic logic;Approximation algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Silicon;Signal processing","","22","","37","IEEE","19 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The support recovery problem is formulated as the selection of nonnegative hyperparameters of a correlation-aware, joint sparsity inducing Gaussian prior. The hyperparameters are recovered as a nonnegative sparse solution of covariance-matching constraints formulated in the observation space by solving a sequence of proximal regularized convex optimization problems. For proximal regularization based on Von Neumann Bregman matrix divergence, an exponentiated gradient (EG) update is proposed, which when applied iteratively, converges to hyperparameters with the correct sparse support. Compared to existing multiple measurement vector support recovery algorithms, the proposed multiplicative EG update has a significantly lower computational and storage complexity and takes fewer iterations to converge. We empirically demonstrate that the support-recovery algorithm based on the proposed EG update can solve million variable support recovery problems in tens of seconds. Additionally, by leveraging its correlation-awareness property, the proposed algorithm can recover supports of size as high as O(m2) from only m linear measurements per joint sparse vector.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2865672","Young Faculty Research Fellowship; Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8437144","Compressive sensing;covariance matching;exponentiated gradient (EG) updates;joint sparsity;multiple measurement vectors;sparse recovery;Von Neumann divergence","Signal processing algorithms;Covariance matrices;Sparse matrices;Symmetric matrices;Noise measurement;Size measurement;Sensors","","7","","20","IEEE","15 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The sensor observations are quantized into one-bit data individually and then sequentially transmitted to a fusion center, which is in charge of making a global decision. We first derive the generalized Rao test statistic as a more computationally efficient alternative when compared to the typical generalized likelihood ratio test statistic. Then, we propose a truncated one-sided sequential (TOS) test rule by imposing a finite maximum stopping time (namely the deadline) on typical one-sided sequential tests. With a deadline slightly larger than the sample size of a benchmarked fixed-sample-size (FSS) test, the proposed TOS test rule provides the same detection performance and significantly accelerates the target-detection process on average, which is corroborated by simulation results.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2865252","China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201703170270); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8437141","Decentralized detection;generalized Rao (G-Rao) test;noncooperative moving target;truncated one-sided sequential (TOS) test","Sensors;Frequency selective surfaces;Probability;Wireless sensor networks;Quantization (signal);Computational complexity;Delays","","11","","18","IEEE","15 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although manual annotation simplifies several stages of the analysis, its use hinders the scalability of the developed solutions and might induce operational problems in scenarios recorded with multiple moving cameras (MMCs). To tackle these problems, an automatic method for the cooperative extraction of areas of interest (AoIs) is proposed. Each captured frame is segmented into regions with semantic roles using a state-of-the-art method. Semantic evidences from different junctures, cameras, and points-of-view are, then, spatio-temporally aligned on a common ground plane. Experimental results on widely used datasets recorded with multiple but static cameras suggest that this process provides broader and more accurate AoIs than those manually defined in the datasets. Moreover, the proposed method naturally determines the projection of obstacles and functional objects in the scene, paving the road towards systems focused on the automatic analysis of human behavior. To our knowledge, this is the first study dealing with this problem, as evidenced by the lack of publicly available MMC benchmarks.

In this paper, we formulate the problem as a tagging problem and propose the use of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to assign the syntactic diacritics for a sentence of Arabic words. These LSTM networks were augmented with sparse direct connections between the input and output layers of the tagger (i.e., maximum entropy (MaxEnt) connections).

Recently, superpixel segmentation has proven to be a powerful tool to exploit the spatial information of hyperspectral images (HSIs), since the size and shape of each superpixel can be adaptively changed in different structural textures. Moreover, spectral information divergence (SID) has superiority compared to other distance-based similarity measures, particularly when using with a JSR classifier. Taking the aforemementioned advantages into account, superpixel segmentation, SID, and JSR are availably combined to effectively utilize the spectralspatial information of the HSI. The proposed SSMR method includes the following main steps. First, superpixel segmentation is utilized to divide the original map into several superpixels. Second, similarity metric SID among test samples in all superpixels and training samples are calculated. Next, the JSR model is employed to obtain the reconstruction residuals of each class. Then, a regularization parameter λ is introduced to attain balance between JSR and SID. Finally, pixel's label is determined by the minimal total residual.

In the classical Bernoulli filter, the clutter process can be arbitrary but the target must be a point target. However, if the target is an extended target or there are multiple propagation paths between the sensor and the target, the measurement process becomes more complicated and single target may produce multiple detections at one scan. Unlike the classical Bernoulli filter, the extended target Bernoulli filter and the multipath Bernoulli filter can be applied to a scenario in which a single target produces multiple detections. However, the clutter process is assumed to be Poisson in these filters. In this letter, the general Bernoulli filter, in which both the clutter and target measurement processes are allowed to be arbitrary, is proposed. The derivation of the filter is on the basis of the probability generating functional in the finite set statistics. In specific circumstances, the general Bernoulli filter can reduce to the classical Bernoulli filter or the multipath Bernoulli filter. In simulation, the measurement model of over-the-horizon radar is used.

For a fixed period, we recently proposed a model for optimizing the coefficients using least squares fitting. Following the compressive bilateral filter (CBF), we demonstrate that the approximation can be improved by taking the period into account during the optimization. The accuracy of the resulting filtering is found to be at least as good as the CBF, but significantly better for certain cases.

In particular, an efficient nonlinear mapping by increasing the depth and width of the network can be learned between the low-resolution input image and the high-resolution target image. However, this will lead to a substantial increase in network parameters, requiring the massive amount of training data to prevent overfitting. Besides, most CNN-based methods ignore the full use of different levels of features and, therefore, achieve relatively low performance. In this letter, we propose a deep convolutional network named densely connected residual networks (DRNet). Our proposed DRNet can reach very deep and wide while requiring fewer parameters. The significant performance improvement of our model is mainly due to the integration of dense skip connection and residual learning. In this way, DRNet mitigates the problems of overfitting, vanishing gradient, and training instability during training very deep and wide networks. Moreover, it can improve the propagation and reuse of features by creating direct connections from the previous layers to the subsequent layers.

Moreover, noise in the background is often amplified because of the fixed amplification factor for the detail layer. In this letter, an effective GIF is proposed for better contrast enhancement. First, the average of local variances for all pixels is incorporated into the cost function of GIF for preserving the edges accurately in the base layer. Second, the amplification factor for the detail layer is calculated in a content-adaptive way for suppressing the noise while boosting the fine details.

Finally, they lead to a new source separation technique based on coherent amplitude and frequency modulation that is evaluated on real-world music signals.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2867799","European H2020 ABC-DJ(grant numbers:688122); ANR ASTRES Project(grant numbers:ANR-13-BS03-0002-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8449972","Audio processing;sinusoidal modeling;source separation;time-frequency analysis","Signal to noise ratio;Time-frequency analysis;Frequency modulation;Source separation;Frequency estimation;Analytical models","","25","","34","IEEE","29 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Instrumental Variable Based Kalman Filter Algorithm for Three-Dimensional AOA Target Tracking","N. H. Nguyen; K.

First, a 3-D pseudolinear Kalman filter (KF) algorithm is derived by applying the classical linear KF to a pseudolinear state-space model. To counter the severe bias problems with this algorithm, bias compensation and recursive instrumental variable (IV) methods are considered. A selective-angle-measurement strategy is also adopted to satisfy requisite conditions for IV estimation. The resulting 3D-IVKF algorithm inherits the low computational complexity and robust performance of pseudolinear estimation techniques. It is shown through simulation examples that the 3D-IVKF algorithm can achieve a similar tracking performance to the sigma-point KFs by producing a negligible bias and a mean-square error close to the posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound at a much reduced computational complexity, while outperforming the extended KFs at high noise levels.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2869108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8456528","Angle of arrival (AOA);instrumental variables (IVs);Kalman filter (KF);pseudolinear estimation;recursive target tracking","Kalman filters;Target tracking;Estimation;Mathematical model;Correlation;Instruments;Signal processing algorithms","","40","","54","IEEE","6 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
