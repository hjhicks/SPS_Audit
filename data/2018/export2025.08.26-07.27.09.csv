For single-image superresolution (SR) processing, previous CNN-based methods have led to significant improvements, when compared to the shallow learning-based methods. However, these CNN-based algorithms with simply direct or skip connections are not suitable for satellite imagery SR because of complex imaging conditions and unknown degradation process. More importantly, they ignore the extraction and utilization of the structural information in satellite images, which is very unfavorable for video satellite imagery SR with such characteristics as small ground targets, weak textures, and over-compression distortion. To this end, this letter proposes a novel progressively enhanced network for satellite image SR called PECNN, which is composed of a pretraining CNN-based network and an enhanced dense connection network. The pretraining part is used to extract the low-level feature maps and reconstructs a basic high-resolution image from the low-resolution input. In particular, we propose a transition unit to obtain the structural information from the base output. Then, the obtained structural information and the extracted low-level feature maps are transmitted to the enhanced network for further extraction to enforce the feature expression. Finally, a residual image with enhanced fine details obtained from the dense connection network is used to enrich the basic image for the ultimate SR output. Experiments on real-world Jilin-1 video satellite images and Kaggle Open Source Dataset show that the proposed PECNN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both in visual effects and quantitative metrics.

"Robustness of $\ell _1$-Norm Estimation: From Folklore to Fact","S. A. Flores","Center for Mathematical Modelling, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, CP, Chile",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,"26 Sep 2018","2018","25","11","1640","1644","The advantages of using $\ell _1$-norm rather than $\ell _2$-norm in terms of robustness for signal processing and other data analysis procedures are largely recognized across the scientific literature. However, from the robust statistic viewpoint, at least that based on the concept of breakdown point,  $\ell _1$-norm regression has no better resistance to outliers than least squares, and it is believed that it degrades in higher dimensions. We explain this seeming contradiction between theory and practice by the different contamination models used to assess robustness of outliers. After a brief review of the existing notions of robustness, we adopt a model where carriers are not subject to contamination, and only the response variable can be contaminated with outliers. We prove two new positive results concerning breakdown point robustness of $\ell _1$-norm regression under this model. First, we show that $\ell _1$ -norm regression can have a positive breakdown point in any dimension, and this is rather common. We elaborate further in a second result, showing that random designs with unit normal rows yield to a high breakdown point, around $\text{30}\%$ for moderate dimension growing asymptotically to $\text{50}\%$, with very large probability. These results provide a theoretical support to the practical success of  $\ell _1$-norm based procedures and are, at the same time, consistent with statistical robust regression theory.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2870962","Fondecyt Iniciacion(grant numbers:11150773,AFB 170001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8467355","Breakdown point; $\ell _1$ -norm minimization;outliers;robust regression","Robustness;Electric breakdown;Estimation;Contamination;Brain modeling;Pollution measurement;Noise measurement","","3","","27","IEEE","18 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most of current consumer devices cannot afford to this emerging technology, and content providers decide to create both an HDR version and an SDR version of the same video. In this letter, scalable high efficiency video coding (HEVC) scalable extension of HEVC (SHVC) serves as the coding framework where the base layer (BL) is an 8-b SDR version and the enhancement layer (EL) is a 12-b HDR version. Recently, many fast coding algorithms for SDR videos are proposed, and there is an urgent demand for fast coding algorithms for EL HDR videos. With the coding information of the BL SDR videos, this letter proposes a fast algorithm to reduce the complexity of intra coding for EL HDR videos. First, depth information of neighboring coding tree units (CTUs) in the HDR version and the colocated CTU in the SDR version is used for early coding unit (CU) depth determination. Moreover, four classifiers are trained to predict the CTU depth range. Two classifiers are trained for CTUs in frames with a high average luma, and another two classifiers are used for CTUs in frames with a low average luma. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves 43% encoding time saving on average, with only a 0.54% Bjøntegaard delta bit rate (BDBR) increase compared to the original SHVC test model.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2867895","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671282,61422111); Shanghai Pujiang Program(grant numbers:15pjd015); Shanghai Science and Technology Innovation Plan(grant numbers:18010500200); Shanghai Shuguang Program(grant numbers:17SG37); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8451924","Classifier;Coding Tree Unit (CTU) depth range;fast intra coding;high dynamic range (HDR);Scalable Extension of HEVC (SHVC);standard dynamic range (SDR)","Videos;Encoding;Correlation;Signal processing algorithms;Open area test sites;Image color analysis;Support vector machines","","11","","25","IEEE","30 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We observed that background noise in utterances will not only enlarge the speaker-dependent i-vector clusters but also shift the clusters, with the amount of shift depending on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the utterances. To overcome this SNR-dependent clustering phenomenon, we propose two deep neural network (DNN) architectures: hierarchical regression DNN (H-RDNN) and multitask DNN (MT-DNN). The H-RDNN is formed by stacking two regression DNNs in which the lower DNN is trained to map noisy i-vectors to their respective speaker-dependent cluster means of clean i-vectors and the upper DNN aims to regularize the outliers that cannot be denoised properly by the lower DNN. The MT-DNN is trained to denoise i-vectors (main task) and classify speakers (auxiliary task). The network leverages the auxiliary task to retain speaker information in the denoised i-vectors. Experimental results suggest that these two DNN architectures together with the PLDA backend significantly outperform the multicondition PLDA model and mixtures of PLDA, and that multitask learning helps to boost verification performance.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2870726","RGC of Hong Kong(grant numbers:1521371/17E); HKPolyU(grant numbers:4-ZZGT); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8466600","Deep learning; ${i}$ -vectors;multitask learning;noise robustness;speaker verification","Task analysis;Signal to noise ratio;Noise measurement;Training;Noise reduction;Neural networks;Production facilities","","7","","28","IEEE","16 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The approach requires resampling the signal at many different rates, which is computationally expensive. For this reason, we propose a filter bank structure that allows us to efficiently resample a signal at many different rates by identifying common interpolation stages among the set of resampling rates.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2871961","Ministerio de Economía of Spain(grant numbers:TEC2013-41718-R); COMONSENS Network(grant numbers:TEC2015-69648-REDC); Ministerio de Economía of Spain; European Commission (ERDF); ADVENTURE(grant numbers:TEC2015-69868-C2-1-R); CAIMAN(grant numbers:TEC2017-86921-C2-2-R); Comunidad de Madrid; CASI-CAM-CM(grant numbers:S2013/ICE-2845); German Research Foundation (DFG)(grant numbers:RA 2662/2-1); German Research Foundation (DFG)(grant numbers:SCHR 1384/6-1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8470969","Almost cyclostationarity;cycle period estimation;detection;multiple hypothesis test;sample rate conversion","Detectors;Interpolation;Maximum likelihood estimation;Gears;Electronic mail;Indexes","","10","","15","IEEE","23 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address the limitations, we propose Dirac-weighted cascading correlation filters (DWCCF) for visual tracking. It incorporates cascading characteristics of multiple filters to construct the target appearance model, and dynamically learns Dirac weights for each filter, which is accordingly robust to appearance variations. Besides, we design a boundary penalization strategy to adaptively reduce the boundary effects, which efficiently improves the detection precision for tracking.

In this letter, we propose solutions to remove those artifacts and apply different filling strategies depending on the nature of each hole. Cracks are identified and filled using very local neighborhood information. Regions classified as ghosts are projected to their correct place. The remaining holes are classified as disocclusions or out-of-field areas, and filled with an appropriate adaptation of a popular inpainting method. In both adaptations, patch matching explores the spatial locality concept, using dynamically adaptive patch sizes from the reference image. For disocclusions we propose a filling order using depth and background terms, and a searching process that considers only background patches.

To approximate the proximal operator in each APG iteration, Vandermonde decomposition is applied to utilize the Toeplitz structure inherent in the line spectral model, and the low-rank property of the Toeplitz-structured matrix is enforced via a simple shrinkage-thresholding operation.

In the literature, semidefinite program (SDP) techniques, together with others, have been applied to approximately solve this problem. Herein, an inner second-order cone program (SOCP) approximate algorithm is proposed to solve it. In particular, a sequence of SOCPs are constructed and solved, while the SOCPs have the nonincreasing optimal values and converge to a locally optimal value (it is in fact a globally optimal value through our extensive simulations). As a result, our algorithm does not use computationally heavy SDP relaxation technique. To validate our inner approximation results, simulation examples are presented, and they demonstrate the improved performance of the new robust beamformer in terms of the averaged cpu-time (indicating how fast the algorithms converge) in a high signal-to-noise region.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2871612","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11871168); Academy of Finland(grant numbers:299243); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8469023","General-rank signal model;inner approximation;robust adaptive beamforming;second-order cone program","Robustness;Array signal processing;Approximation algorithms;Covariance matrices;Signal processing algorithms;Adaptation models;Signal to noise ratio","","10","","38","IEEE","20 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The discrimination power of existing and proposed features is assessed through mutual information. Multiple supervised and unsupervised approaches are compared. A significant relative reduction of voicing errors over the best baseline is obtained-20% with the best clustering method (K-means) and 45% with a multi-layer perceptron.
