The closeness of LSFs criterion leads to a lower threshold when compared to MUSIC, with improvements ranging from  $\text{0}$ to  $\text{2}$ dB for the well-known two-sinusoids example; with pseudo-noise resampling the improvement is up to $\text{4}$ dB.

However, the product rule for derivatives in continuous spaces, ∂(fg) = g∂f + f∂g, does not generally hold in discretized spaces. Hence, computing the gradient of products becomes ambiguous as the results depend on whether to treat the product fg as a single function or treat f and g as two separate functions and use the product rule. The two alternatives lead to different results, particularly for iterative solutions of differential equations since these small differences compound. Although this ambiguity is well-known, thus far a resolution has not been proposed in the literature. In this letter, we propose a mathematically rigorous procedure that selects the better alternative in the sense of yielding approximations that are closer to the continuous space results.

First, a deep convolutional network is used to extract multilevel feature maps and separately aggregate them into multiple resolutions, which can be used to generate coarse saliency maps. Meanwhile, another boundary information extraction branch is proposed to generate boundary features. Finally, an attention-based feature fusion module is designed to fuse boundary information into salient regions to achieve accurate boundary inference and semantic enhancement. The final saliency maps are the combination of the predicted boundary maps and integrated saliency maps, which are more closer to the ground truths.

The spectrum is a function that describes power as a function of frequency. To date inference procedures for spectra have focused on constructing confidence intervals at single frequencies using large sample-based analytic procedures or jackknife techniques. These procedures perform well when the frequencies of interest are chosen before the analysis. When these frequencies are chosen after some of the data have been analyzed, the validity of these conditional inferences is not addressed. If power at more than one frequency is investigated, corrections for multiple comparisons must also be incorporated. To develop a statistical inference approach that considers the spectrum as a function defined across frequencies, we combine multitaper spectral methods with a frequency-domain bootstrap (FDB) procedure. The multitaper method is optimal for minimizing the bias-variance tradeoff in spectral estimation. The FDB makes it possible to conduct Monte Carlo based inferences for any part of the spectrum by drawing random samples that respect the dependence structure in the EEG time series. We show that our multitaper FDB procedure performs well in simulation studies and in analyses comparing EEG recordings of children from two different age groups receiving general anesthesia.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2876606","National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:2017R1C1B5017254,2018M3C1B8017549); Korean Government (MSIP); National Institute of Health(grant numbers:R01-GM104948,P01-GM118269); Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care, and Pain Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital; Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8494714","Confidence interval;frequency-domain bootstrap (FDB);multitaper methods;spectra resampling","Frequency-domain analysis;Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Frequency estimation;Time series analysis;Anesthesia;Spectral analysis","","8","","28","IEEE","17 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To avoid distortion, a mixed-domain proximal operator is mathematically formulated, which permits interference to be separated from data concurrently during a combined processing stage. The technique is demonstrated with an application involving optoacoustic imaging. Reconstruction is performed with an accelerated proximal gradient method. Total-variation minimization is used to promote smoothness in the image domain. In the data domain, interference is modeled as a low-rank matrix, which corresponds to a few time dependent interference components being coupled to each channel by determined amounts.

By utilizing prospect theory, a behavioral decision-maker is modeled to cognitively distort probabilities and costs based on some weight and value functions, respectively. It is proved that the LRT may or may not be an optimal decision rule for prospect theory-based binary hypothesis testing, and conditions are derived to specify different scenarios. In addition, it is shown that when the LRT is an optimal decision rule, it corresponds to a randomized decision rule in some cases; i.e., nonrandomized LRTs may not be optimal. This is unlike Bayesian binary hypothesis testing, in which the optimal decision rule can always be expressed in the form of a nonrandomized LRT. Finally, it is proved that the optimal decision rule for prospect theory-based binary hypothesis testing can always be represented by a decision rule that randomizes at most two LRTs. Two examples are presented to corroborate the theoretical results.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2877048","Air Force Office of Scientific Research(grant numbers:FA9550-17-1-0313); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8501545","Detection;hypothesis testing;likelihood ratio test;prospect theory;randomization","Testing;Bayes methods;Minimization;Random processes","","15","","12","IEEE","21 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hence, we propose a multi-scale capsule network that is more robust and efficient for feature representation in image classification. The proposed multi-scale capsule network consists of two stages. In the first stage, structural and semantic information are obtained by multi-scale feature extraction. In the second stage, the hierarchy of features is encoded to multi-dimensional primary capsules. Moreover, we propose an improved dropout to enhance the robustness of the capsule network.

In these approaches, typically, the system makes a decision by leveraging the current available information about the state. However, trusting the current best estimate results in poor query selection when truth is far from the current estimate, and this negatively impacts the speed and accuracy of the latent variable estimation procedure. We introduce a novel sequential adaptive action value function for query selection using the multi-armed bandit framework, which allows us to find a tractable solution. For this adaptive-sequential query selection method, we analytically show: 1) performance improvement in the query selection for a dynamical system; and 2) the conditions where the model outperforms competitors. We also present favorable empirical assessments of the performance for this method, compared to alternative methods, both using Monte Carlo simulations and human-in-the-loop experiments with a brain–computer interface typing system, where the language model provides the prior information.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2878066","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1149570,CNS-1544895); National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research(grant numbers:90RE5017-02-01); National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:R01DC009834); NSF(grant numbers:IIS-1717654); Air Force Office of Scientific Research through the Dynamic Data Driven Applications Systems Program(grant numbers:FA9550-16-1-0386); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8510894","Subset selection;query optimization;misleading prior;multi-armed bandit framework","State estimation;Task analysis;Mutual information;Decision making;Query processing","","7","","36","IEEE","26 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we show the advantage of learning the combination of multiscale information by aiming to automatically capture complementary and discriminative feature representations from different scales of vibration signals. Specifically, we combine the merit of different activation functions in a joint learning fashion and propose a novel joint multiple reconstructions autoencoder (JMRAE), whose training objective is to jointly optimize multiple reconstruction losses. The JMRAE aims to jointly learn discriminative and robust scale-specific feature representations. In addition, we design a new multiscale representations fusion network (MRFN) model to effectively fuse multiscale feature representations learned concurrently by per-scale JMRAE model for maximizing the discriminative capability of the scale-fused features. The objective of MRFN is to benefit all different scales from each other for improving the classification performance.

The virtual image is generated via intensity mapping functions. In order to avoid possible color distortion in the virtual image due to one-to-many mapping, two intermediate virtual images with the same exposure time are generated by the two input images, and then merged together to produce the desired virtual image using properly defined weights. The final image is obtained by fusing the original two input images and the virtual image via a state-of-the-art MEF algorithm.

Correlation filter (CF) based methods significantly advanced state-of-the-art tracking. The advancement in CF tracking performance is predominantly attributed to powerful features and sophisticated online learning formulations. However, there would be trouble if the tracker indiscriminately learned samples. Particularly, when the target is severely occluded or out-of-view, the tracker will continuously learn the wrong information, resulting target loss in the following frames. In this study, aiming to avoid incorrect training when occlusions occur, we propose a regional color histogram-based occlusion estimating agency (RCHBOEA), which estimates the occlusion level and then instructs, based on the result, the tracker to work in one of two modes: normal or lost. In the normal mode, an occlusion level-based self-adopting learning rate is used for tracker training. In the lost mode, the tracker pauses its training and conducts a search and recapture strategy on a wider searching area. Our method can easily complement CF-based trackers. In our experiments, we employed four CF-based trackers as a baseline: discriminative CFs (DCF), kernelized CFs (KCF), background-aware CFs (BACF), and efficient convolution operators for tracking: hand-crafted feature version (ECO_HC). We performed extensive experiments on the standard benchmarks: VIVID, OTB50, and OTB100. The results demonstrated that combined with RCHBOEA, the trackers achieved a remarkable improvement.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2856102","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61705225); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8410816","Overcome occlusion;regional color histogram (RCH);self-adopting learning rate;visual tracking","Target tracking;Tracking;Histograms;Visual systems","","5","","15","IEEE","13 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
