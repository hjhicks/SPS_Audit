However, the long taper of the Gaussian window (GW) and the scaling criterion lead to poor time resolution at lower frequencies and poor frequency resolution at higher frequencies. This letter proposes a novel optimally concentrated discrete window (OCDW) based on a constraint optimization problem of maximization of the product of time- and frequency-domain energy concentrations in given time and frequency intervals. Furthermore, it is extended to design an OCDW-based ST for multiresolution analysis. A new scaling criterion is also presented for the OCDW-based ST, which prevents unnecessary deterioration in frequency resolution at higher frequencies and time resolution at lower frequencies. The efficacy of the proposed approach is examined using a synthetic signal having multiple power quality disturbances. Simulation results show that the proposed OCDW-based ST provides higher energy concentration in time-frequency distribution (TFD) than that of the GW-based ST. The simulation results also illustrate the superiority of the proposed scaling criterion in terms of the tradeoff between time and frequency resolution in TFD.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2879522","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8521594","Time-frequency analysis;discrete ST;energy concentration","Time-frequency analysis;Microsoft Windows;Energy resolution;Signal resolution;Manganese;Time-domain analysis","","5","","10","IEEE","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, we propose a novel framework for unwrapping the phase using deep fully convolutional neural network termed as PhaseNet. We reformulate the problem definition of directly obtaining continuous original phase as obtaining the wrap-count (integer jump of 2 π) at each pixel by semantic segmentation and this is accomplished through a suitable deep learning framework. The proposed architecture consists of an encoder network, a corresponding decoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The relationship between the absolute phase and the wrap-count is leveraged in generating abundant simulated data of several random shapes. This deliberates the network on learning continuity in wrapped phase maps rather than specific patterns in the training data. We compare the proposed framework with the widely adapted quality-guided phase unwrapping algorithm and also with the well-known MATLAB's unwrap function for varying noise levels. The proposed framework is found to be robust to noise and computationally fast. The results obtained highlight that deep convolutional neural network can indeed be effectively applied for phase unwrapping, and the proposed framework will hopefully pave the way for the development of a new set of deep learning based phase unwrapping methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2879184","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519608","Decoder;deep convolutional neural network;encoder;phase unwrapping;semantic segmentation","Training;Decoding;Signal processing algorithms;Semantics;Matlab;Shape","","223","","25","IEEE","1 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to address this tradeoff more effectively, variable step-size schemes have been proposed. The efficiency evaluation of such techniques requires comparisons of the resulting step-size values with theoretical optimum values obtained from a statistical analysis of the adaptive algorithm convergence. The analysis generally employs statistical approximations, the most critical being the assumption of independence between the input signal and the filter coefficients. In this letter, it is argued that such a comparison can be misleading because the supposedly optimal step-size sequence sometimes induces divergence in the initial phase of learning. This occurs most often when the input signal is colored and/or heavy tailed. This instability trend can be explained by a convergence analysis that does not employ the independence hypothesis. In addition, the use of this exact analysis implies an optimal step-size sequence that can be significantly different from that obtained with standard analysis methods. This approach can be used to improve the design process of variable step-size adaptive filtering algorithms.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2880084","National Council for Scientific and Technological Development; Carlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support in the State of Rio de Janeiro; Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8526299","Adaptive filtering;variable step size;exact expectation analysis","Mathematical model;Convergence;Adaptive algorithms;Steady-state;Noise measurement;Correlation;Computational modeling","","26","","20","IEEE","7 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Blocking mainly results from the block-level quantization of the luma component, while color bleeding is mainly caused by the subsampling and quantization of chroma components. Restoring luma can reduce blocking distortion, but with little influence on color bleeding. On the contrary, color bleeding can be removed via chroma components restoration. This letter proposes a deep wide-activated residual network for reducing blocking and color bleeding artifacts simultaneously, in which the luma and chroma components are jointly restored. Chroma components usually suffer from more severe distortion than the luma component due to subsampling and coarse quantization. Thus, we use the luma component to guide the restoration of chroma components. Moreover, we reduce blocking and color bleeding artifacts in low-resolution space via pixel shuffle-based decimation and assembling, which allows to obtain high restoration speed.

We train the CAE on a synthetically generated dataset composed of pristine images and their distorted versions. Specifically, the dataset was created by applying standard distortions such as JPEG compression, JP2K compression, additive white Gaussian noise, and blur to the pristine images. SSIM maps are then generated on a per distorted image basis for each of the distorted images in the dataset and are in turn used for training the CAE. We first qualitatively demonstrate the robustness of the proposed distortion map generation algorithm over several images with both traditional and authentic distortions. We also demonstrate the distortion map's effectiveness quantitatively on both standard distortions and authentic distortions by deriving three different NRIQA algorithms. We show that these NRIQA algorithms deliver competitive performance over traditional databases like LIVE Phase II, CSIQ, TID 2013, LIVE MD, and MDID 2013, and databases with authentic distortions like LIVE Wild and KonIQ-10K.

Based on the continuous rotation invariance and highly discriminative characteristic of principal curvatures, significant local geometrical information, which is complementary to LBP is obtained. Then, the resulting information is quantized and encoded into a binary pattern. To enhance the robustness to scale, viewpoint, and the number of training samples, a multiscale and multiresolution analysis is explored by diversifying two parameters accordantly. Subsequently, a cross-scale joint feature representation is conducted on the generated complementary binary responses, resulting in the proposed CCLBP, which captures a highly discriminative information but with low dimensionality. Experimental results on three standard texture databases demonstrate that the proposed CCLBP achieves competitive performance or outperforms state-of-the-art texture descriptors while enjoying a succinct feature representation.

The phase-based algorithms have good estimation performance in the case of high SNR, but the complexity is high. In order to solve these problems, a new chirp rate estimation algorithm by multiple discrete polynomial phase transform (DPT) and weighted combination is proposed. In this algorithm, the chirp rate estimation is simplified to multiple frequency estimations by multiple DPT. Then, in frequency estimation, a new unbiased interpolator is proposed to eliminate the contradiction of search-based algorithms. Finally, the multiple estimates are combined through the optimal weighting factors which are obtained by theoretical derivation to minimize the root mean square error.

However, little attention has been paid to the structured light field. In this letter, a network for structured light is proposed to extract effective matching features for depth acquisition. The proposed network promotes the Siamese network by considering receptive fields of different scales and assigning proper weights to the corresponding features, which is achieved by combining pyramid-pooling structure with the squeeze-and-excitation network into the Siamese network for feature extraction and weight calculations, respectively. For network training and testing, a structured-light dataset with amended ground truths is generated by projecting a random pattern into the existing binocular stereo dataset. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed network is capable of real-time depth acquisition, and it provides superior depth maps using structured light.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2883865","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61231010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8550745","Structured light;stereo matching;siamese network;SLNet","Feature extraction;Cameras;Three-dimensional displays;Training;Convolution;Kernel;Testing","","19","","23","IEEE","28 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Despite their demonstrated success, features described earlier find difficulty in representing a relational change among joint movements in 3-D space for classifying human actions. To characterize a relation between joints on 3-D skeleton, we propose spatial 3-D relational geometric features (S3DRGFs). S3DRGFs are calculated on a subset of four joints in a chronological order covering all joints on the skeleton. Each of these four joints shape into a polygon, that reshapes spatially and temporally with respect to the sign (action) in the 3-D video. Consequently, we construct the spatio-temporal features (S3DRGF) by computing the area and perimeter of these polygons. Accordingly, query 3-D sign (action) recognition process transforms the joint area and perimeter features (JAF and JPF) into global alignment kernels based on the computed similarity scores with the dataset features. The similarity scores from JAF and JPF kernels are averaged for recognition. The proposed framework has been tested on our own 3-D sign language dataset (BVC3DSL) and three other publicly available datasets: HDM05, CMU, and NTU RGBD skeletal data. The results show higher levels of accuracy in decoding 3-D sign language into text for building a 3-D model based sign language translator.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2883864","Department of Science and Technology, SEED division, India(grant numbers:SEED/TIDE/013/2014(G)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8550661","Joint area features;joint perimeter features;global alignment kernels;3D sign language recognition","Three-dimensional displays;Kernel;Assistive technology;Gesture recognition;Skeleton;Solid modeling;Sensors","","19","","30","IEEE","28 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A sampling theory for signals in FrWT-based multiresolution subspaces has been proposed recently. However, the signals to be sampled are regarded as lowpass signals indiscriminately. When dealing with bandpass or multiband signals, the sampling rate could be unnecessarily high. This letter investigates the sampling theory of multiband signals in multiresolution subspaces associated with the FrWT. The nonideal sampling and reconstruction scheme we proposed can guarantee lower sampling rate, fewer sampling points but subequal reconstruction performances. Numerical experiments are presented to validate the theoretical derivations.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2883832","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801024); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8552372","Fractional Fourier transform;fraction wavelet transform;multiband signals;consistent sampling","Signal resolution;Wavelet transforms;Convolution;Image reconstruction;Image resolution;Wavelet analysis","","2","","39","IEEE","29 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When only an amplitude spectrogram is available and no explicit information is given for the phases, the Griffin–Lim algorithm (GLA) is one of the most utilized methods for phase recovery. However, GLA often requires many iterations and results in low perceptual quality in some cases. In this letter, we propose two novel algorithms based on GLA and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for better recovery with fewer iteration. Some interpretation of the existing methods and their relation to the proposed method are also provided.

Users requesting the same content form a multicast group, served by remote radio heads (RRHs) cooperatively. Each RRH acquires the requested contents from baseband unit via backhaul links. We first formulate the robust beamforming design as maximizing the sum of the minimum rate of users in each multicast group under the transmission power and backhaul constraints. Due to the introduction of the channel estimation error and inter-user interference, the considered problem becomes more complex and difficult to address directly. To overcome these difficulties, convex approximation methods are adopted to transform the original problem into convex one. Then, an effective optimization algorithm is developed to address the resulting problem. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust beamforming design of multigroup multicast transmission.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2882692","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61471120,61711540305); National Science and Technology Major Project of China(grant numbers:2018ZX03001002-003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8543205","Robust Beamforming;Multigroup Multicast;Cloud Radio Access Network;Convex Approximation","Array signal processing;Optimization;Cloud computing;Radio access networks;Interference;Information science;Multicast algorithms","","13","","24","IEEE","22 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The phase wrap is present in both returns but they are the same. Therefore, the differential phase matching used to pair the returns from the same target cancels out the phase wrap. No phase unwrapping is needed. The proposed method has no inherent maximum unambiguous range or velocity, works in multitarget theaters, requires a much lower sampling rate, is not affected by range migration, decouples the Doppler cycle from the pulse repetition frequency and is computationally more efficient than FFT-based methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2885215","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8561253","Phase wrapping;phase matching;delay-Doppler coupling;multitarget","Chirp;Doppler effect;Frequency estimation;Frequency conversion;Wrapping;Delays;Radar","","9","","19","IEEE","5 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Finally, the refocused image is produced by a reconstruction-based superresolution approach where the bokeh image is used as a regularization term. Our method can selectively refocus images with focused region being superresolved and bokeh being esthetically rendered. Our method also enables postadjustment of depth of field.
