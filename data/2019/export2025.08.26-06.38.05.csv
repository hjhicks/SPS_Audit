A key issue of a hybrid scheme is distribution of the information sharing coefficients (ISCs) of subsystems and the fusion of parallel multiple observations of navigation sensors. Recently, deep learning methods, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have achieved great success in image processing tasks. However, there has been limited work in using deep learning for multisensor-based integrated navigation solutions. In this letter, we propose an ensemble learner-based classification and information fusion method, in which estimation error covariance matrices provided by local adaptive filters are used as input for the classifier, and the triple numbers of ISCs are determined by the proposed scheme. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, in which the adequately trained ensemble learner can detect the degradation of a subsystem that may suffer atypical observations or faults and consequently can adjust the corresponding ISC in real time.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2885511","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571167,61471142,61102084); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8570762","Hybrid navigation;convolutional neural networks (CNN);information fusion;ensemble learner","Sensors;Covariance matrices;Global navigation satellite system;Estimation;Support vector machines","","18","","43","IEEE","9 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although segmentation methods purely based on visual input have achieved great success in the past decade, their further improvement is still hindered by the intrinsic drawback of color camouflage. With the rapid development and wide deployment of depth sensors, depth assisted methods are increasingly popular in visual perception systems. It is expected that RGB-D based methods can lead to significant performance improvements because color and depth are naturally complementary. However, how to merge color and depth modalities for segmentation with both high efficiency and high accuracy remains an open problem to be addressed. In this letter, we propose to divide the segmentation process into “coarse” and “refining” stages because a coarse segmentation can be easily obtained by various light-weight methods. In this way, we can tackle this problem by focusing on the refinement of coarse segmentations. In particular, we propose a multi-scale approach that selectively inherits the effective features of both edge-preserving filtering and deep neural networks. The proposed approach is evaluated on several benchmark datasets, respectively, using the coarse segmentations from background subtraction and object detection as the input. Numerous results indicate that our approach can achieve significant accuracy improvements compared to other alternatives, demonstrating superior edge-preserving capability. Besides an effective method for merging RGB-D information, our study on the capability of coarse-to-fine refinement also brings new inspirations for designing light-weight perception systems.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2886470","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61602533); Major program of Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2017B010116003); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:1614050001452); NSFC-Shenzhen Robotics Projects(grant numbers:U1613211); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China(grant numbers:201510010126); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8573890","Image segmentation;sensor fusion;edge-preserving filtering","Image color analysis;Image edge detection;Image segmentation;Object segmentation;Task analysis;Optimization;Color","","3","","26","IEEE","12 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Block orthogonal matching pursuit (BOMP) is a popular greedy algorithm for recovering block sparse signals due to its high efficiency and effectiveness. By fully using the block sparsity of block sparse signals, BOMP can achieve very good recovery performance.

We prove that these CCSs are mutually orthogonal and their direct sum form a φ(N) dimensional subspace sN of CN. We propose that any signal of finite length N is represented as a linear combination of elements from a special basis of sd, for each divisor d of N. This defines a new transform named as complex conjugate periodic transform (CCPT). Later, we compared CCPT with discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and Ramanujan periodic transform (RPT). It is shown that, using CCPT, we can estimate the period, hidden periods, and frequency information of a signal. Whereas, RPT does not provide the frequency information. For a complex valued input signal, CCPT offers computational benefit over DFT.

In this letter, we present a method for passive self-calibration of a distributed system in which each distributed node consists of an array of sensors. The proposed method estimates the positions and orientations of distributed sensor arrays, the synchronization timeline offsets as well as the positions of spatially distributed events emitted by an uncontrolled source or sources. The proposed two-step optimization consists in finding the maximum likelihood estimate of the relative geometry of a distributed system based on Directions of Arrival (DoAs) observed independently at each array. Next, the final positions of distributed arrays, the positions of acoustic events, and the synchronization offsets between the nodes are computed by solving a linear least square problem based on the observed Time Differences of Arrival (TDoAs) between the arrays and the relative positions estimated in the first optimization step. The evaluation results indicate that passive self-calibration of distributed sensor arrays can be conveniently achieved by observing acoustic events generated by an uncontrolled source based on the measured DoAs and TDoAs.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2889438","Fundacja na rzecz Nauki Polskiej(grant numbers:TEAM/2017-3/23); European Regional Development Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8586946","Microphone array processing;distributed sensor networks;geometry calibration;synchronization;maximum likelihood estimation;least squares approximation","Synchronization;Geometry;Direction-of-arrival estimation;Sensor arrays;Acoustics;Microphones","","34","","21","IEEE","23 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, angle 2DPCA was presented to alleviate this problem by minimizing the sum of Fnorm, which is corresponding to L1 loss. But a vital unresolved problem of angle 2DPCA is that it needs many more coefficients for image representation because it works only in the row direction. In this letter, we first give a new angle 2DPCA called Sin-2DPCA by minimizing the relative error, which has a better explanation than the original one. Furthermore, in order to obtain better performance with fewer reduced coefficients, we project the input image to a lower dimension from right and left simultaneously, and then, the bilateral angle 2DPCA (BA2DPCA) is proposed. The experimental results on two benchmark face recognition datasets with outlier noises illustrate that the Sin-2DPCA has the similar performance with original angle 2DPCA, and BA2DPCA can obtain the highest performance in all compared algorithms with the minimal number of representation coefficients.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2018.2889925","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772020,61472303); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8590694","Face recognition;dimensionality reduction;2DPCA;F-norm;angle 2DPCA","Image reconstruction;Principal component analysis;Signal processing algorithms;Covariance matrices;Training;Face recognition;Image representation","","15","","17","IEEE","27 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Meanwhile, sparse coding is able to produce sparse de-correlated features that decision tree is in favor of. For further improvement, we close the loop of sparse coding and decision tree learning with an ensemble framework, which alternatively learns a dictionary for sparse coding and a decision tree for classification. The resulting series of decision trees as well as series of dictionaries are used to construct a decision forest for classification.

A smooth rank approximation is utilized to endorse lower rank on the genuine data matrix. Thus, an unconstrained optimization problem with differentiable objective function is obtained allowing us to advantage from gradient descent technique.

However, when signals are seriously contaminated by non-Gaussian noises, the LRM coefficients will be inaccurately identified. This may cause the GCA to detect a wrong causal relationship. Minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion can be used to replace the MSE criterion to deal with the non-Gaussian noises. But its calculation requires a double summation operation, which brings computational bottlenecks to GCA especially when sizes of the signals are large. To address the aforementioned problems, in this letter, we propose a new method called GCA based on the quantized MEE (QMEE) criterion (GCA-QMEE), in which the QMEE criterion is applied to identify the LRM coefficients and the quantized error entropy is used to calculate the causality indexes. Compared with the traditional GCA, the proposed GCA-QMEE not only makes the results more discriminative, but also more robust. Its computational complexity is also not high because of the quantization operation. Illustrative examples on synthetic and EEG datasets are provided to verify the desirable performance and the availability of the GCA-QMEE.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2890973","973 Program(grant numbers:2015CB351703); National NSF of China(grant numbers:91648208,U1613219); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8601314","Granger causality analysis;mean square error criterion;minimum error entropy criterion;quantized minimum error entropy criterion;linear regression model","Entropy;Quantization (signal);Time series analysis;Indexes;Analytical models;Computational complexity;Linear regression","","18","","28","IEEE","4 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While if the pairs have larger distance, metric should focus more on shrinking the positive pairs. However, most metric learning methods neglect these differences. In this letter, we propose a distance-dependent metric learning (D2ML) method. It partitions data pairs into different clusters according to the ℓ2 distance between them. Each cluster is associated with a Mahalanobis metric that learns the pairs' distance. This not only allows us to make each metric more targeted and adapt to the data diversity flexibly, but also avoids the problem of computing the distance between points assigned to different clusters, which happens in some local metric learning methods. D2ML is further extended to D3ML to embrace the nonlinear capacity of neural network.

It was recently shown that fast and accurate bilateral filtering of grayscale images can be performed using a low-rank approximation of the kernel matrix. More specifically, based on the eigendecomposition of the kernel matrix, the overall filtering was approximated using spatial convolutions, for which efficient algorithms are available. Unfortunately, this technique cannot be scaled to high-dimensional data such as color and hyperspectral images. This is simply because one needs to compute/store a large matrix and perform its eigendecomposition in this case. We show how this problem can be solved using the Nystr$\ddot{\text{o}}$m method, which is generally used for approximating the eigendecomposition of large matrices. The resulting algorithm can also be used for nonlocal means filtering. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal for bilateral and nonlocal means filtering of color and hyperspectral images.

In contrast to previous works focused on two-tier networks, the derived DoF consider the management of the intracell, the intercell, and intertier interference. The derived bounds define the DoF region for any two-tier network. Furthermore, these bounds are achievable by combining blind interference alignment schemes properly.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2891881","TERESA(grant numbers:TEC2017-90093-C3-2-R); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8606163","Degrees of Freedom;2-tier networks;Blind Interference Alignment;multi-mode receivers","Transmitters;Interference;Receivers;Entropy;Mutual information;Uncertainty;Channel state information","","3","","15","IEEE","9 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
