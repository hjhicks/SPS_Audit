Sepecifically, SDFAWL uses a novel unified objective function to simultaneously learn the discriminant features, adaptive feature weights, and classification coefficients. First, a discriminant feature projection is incorporated into group sparse representation model, which reduces the intra-class distance between training samples. Second, we integrate adaptive feature weights into our model to penalize the noisy pixels, which is simultaneously learned by our unified objective function. Besides, we derive an efficient algorithm to optimize the proposed objective function, where the simultaneously learning scheme can encourage obtained parameters combining better and decrease the information loss.

Our model, named multi-context generative adversarial networks (MCGAN), automatically learns the hierarchical appearances of a corrupted image and predicted the missing regions from different perspectives. In this model, semantic understanding and high-frequency details are both taken into account and modeled with two parallel networks, respectively. While one learns the semantic understanding of the input face image at a high level, the other extracts low-level features for high-frequency details prediction.

Moreover, asymptotically optimal one-bit quantizers at all the sensor nodes are designed for the proposed one-bit LMPT detector. In this letter, model uncertainties are interpreted as multiplicative noise and its variance represents the strength of model uncertainties. Theoretical analysis indicates that, when the strength of model uncertainties is finite, the proposed detector using one-bit data with πN/2 sensors approximately achieves the same detection performance as the clairvoyant detector that directly uses analog measurements with N sensors.

The integrals required to evaluate the symbol error rate (SER) of these constellations in the presence of Gaussian noise are in general difficult to compute in closed form, and therefore Monte Carlo simulation is typically used to estimate the SER. However, naive Monte Carlo simulation can be very inefficient and requires very long simulation runs, especially at high signal-to-noise ratios. In this letter, we adapt a recently proposed multiple importance sampling technique, called ALOE (for “at least one rare event”), to this problem. Conditioned to a transmitted symbol, an error (or rare event) occurs when the observation falls in a union of half-spaces or, equivalently, outside a given polytope. The proposal distribution for ALOE samples the system conditionally on an error taking place, which makes it more efficient than other importance sampling techniques. ALOE provides unbiased SER estimates with simulation times orders of magnitude shorter than conventional Monte Carlo.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2892835","Agence Nationale de la Recherche of France(grant numbers:ANR-17-CE40-0031-01); French-American Fulbright Commission; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad (MINECO) of Spain, and AEI/FEDER funds of the E.U.(grant numbers:TEC2016-75067-C4-4-R); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8611088","Improper constellations;lattices;Monte Carlo;multiple importance sampling;symbol error rate","Monte Carlo methods;Proposals;Lattices;Error analysis;Signal to noise ratio;Error probability;Estimation","","16","","31","IEEE","13 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Data points lying on a union of low-dimensional nonlinear manifolds are expected to be highly conforming. On the other hand, outliers do not typically adhere to low-dimensional structures or otherwise do not exist in large numbers. Hence, they can be identified by their low overall resemblance to the rest of the data. Our kernel-based setting allows us to capture the underlying nonlinear structure of the manifold data, while avoiding the construction of local neighborhood regions which typically causes extreme sensitivity to noise and outliers. Aside from its significantly simple structure-involving only a matrix evaluation and multiplication-GCP is the first manifold learning approach that is simultaneously noniterative and capable of tolerating a large number of outliers, dependent outliers, and noise components. Theoretical analysis guarantees a large gap between conformity values of inliers and outliers. Experimental results showcase potential uses of the proposed framework on benchmark datasets.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2893064","NSF(grant numbers:CCF-1552497); NSF(grant numbers:1643835,1161228,1356233); CSIT TEAm BOG; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8611397","Global conformity;manifold learning;outlier detection;reproducing kernel","Manifolds;Kernel;Data models;Principal component analysis;Signal processing algorithms;Indexes;Anomaly detection","","8","","35","IEEE","13 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Actually, it is a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) based on the conditional (i.e., for given S) distribution of the adaptively whitened data. In this letter, we investigate detection of a Gaussian rank-one signal using the marginal (unconditional) distribution of the adaptively whitened data. A first contribution is to derive the latter and to show that it only depends on a scalar parameter, namely the signal to noise ratio. Then, a GLRT is formulated from this unconditional distribution and shown to have the constant false alarm rate property. We show that it bears close resemblance with the plain GLRT based on the whole data set (data under test and training samples). The new detector performs as well as the plain GLRT and even better with multiple cells under test and low training sample support.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2893761","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8616752","Adaptive detection;Cholesky factorization;Gaussian rank-one signals;generalized likelihood ratio test;Wishart matrices","Training;Covariance matrices;Detectors;Signal to noise ratio;Testing;Gaussian distribution","","9","","25","IEEE","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show the asymptotic optimality by proving that the PF-based approximation of the LR converges to the true LR as the number of particles increases to infinity. We also discuss the practical and operational implications of the result, the main one being that it is optimal in the sense that no other processing and detection mechanism can have higher probability of detection, while having the same or lower false alarm rate.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2895279","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8625570","Particle filters;detection problem;hypothesis testing;Neyman Pearson optimality","Convergence;Radar tracking;Detectors;Radar detection;Noise measurement;Testing","","22","","14","IEEE","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike the standard SR model, which is based on single image component and overlapping patches, the CS-MCA model can simultaneously achieve multi-component and global SRs of source images, by integrating MCA and convolutional sparse representation (CSR) into a unified optimization framework. For each source image, in the proposed fusion method, the CSRs of its cartoon and texture components are first obtained by the CS-MCA model using pre-learned dictionaries. Then, for each image component, the sparse coefficients of all the source images are merged and the fused component is accordingly reconstructed using the corresponding dictionary. Finally, the fused image is calculated as the superposition of the fused cartoon and texture components. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform some benchmarking and state-of-the-art SR-based fusion methods in terms of both visual perception and objective assessment.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2895749","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61701160,81571760); Provincial Natural Science Foundation of Anhui(grant numbers:1808085QF186); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:JZ2018HGTB0228); SenseTime Research Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8627371","Medical image fusion;sparse representation (SR);morphological component analysis (MCA);convolutional sparse representation (CSR);dictionary learning","Image fusion;Biomedical imaging;Standards;Convolution;Image coding;Signal processing algorithms;Dictionaries","","255","","48","IEEE","27 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most of the existing DCF trackers only consider the spatial features of the target and could hardly benefit from the inter-frame and historical information, which may degrade the tracking performance when occlusion and deformation occurs. To tackle the above-mentioned issues, in this letter, by introducing the temporal constrain into the DCF tracker, we advocate our spatial-temporal context-aware tracker. Through jointly modeling the spatial context and historical target information, our tracker could not only adapt the appearance change but also maintain a relatively stable filter due to the small target variation between inter-frames. Furthermore, we show that the proposed objective formula could be directly solved using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) technique with low computational cost. Experiments on the large-scale benchmark demonstrate that the proposed trackers perform favorably against other state-of-the-art methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2895962","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:91438203); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8629006","Visual tracking;correlation filter;spatial-temporal constrain","Target tracking;Signal processing algorithms;Computational modeling;Context modeling;Training;Benchmark testing","","48","","36","IEEE","29 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Data generation methods can help increase the size of the dataset and make variations to the training dataset by means of emerging new instances. We propose a novel labeled utterance generation algorithm to augment training data. Our hypothesis is that words in an utterance can be separated into the two parts, namely, slot values that are instances of slot types and the accompanying contexts. Our model aims to generate utterances that are diverse combinations of slot values and contexts that can appear together. To create various utterances containing a given condition, our deep generative model uses a conditional variational auto-encoder architecture. We conduct experiments on various slot filling datasets, specifically airline travel information systems (ATIS), Snips, and MIT Corpus. A quantitative analysis shows that the application of data augmentation using the proposed model improves the F1 score for slot filling. We also demonstrate that our labeled utterance generation model yields more desirable utterances.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2895284","National Research Foundation of Korea; Korea government (MSIT)(grant numbers:NRF2016M3C4A7952587); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8625384","Variational auto-encoder (VAE);data generation;data augmentation;slot filling","Decoding;Generators;Training;Computational modeling;Training data;Filling;Context modeling","","4","","25","IEEE","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Regularization of NMF using the assumption of sparsity is common as well as regularization using smoothness. In many applications it is natural to assume that both of these assumptions hold together. To avoid ad hoc combination of these assumptions using weighting coefficient, we formulate the problem using a probabilistic model and estimate it in a Bayesian way. Specifically, we use the fact that the assumptions of sparsity and smoothness are different forms of prior covariance matrix modeling. We use a generalized model that includes both sparsity and smoothness as special cases and estimate all its parameters using the variational Bayes method. The resulting matrix factorization algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms on large clinical dataset of 196 image sequences from dynamic renal scintigraphy. The proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms in statistical evaluation.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2897230","Czech Science Foundation(grant numbers:GA18-07247S); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8633424","Non-negative matrix factorization;covariance matrix model;blind source separation;variational Bayes method;dynamic renal scintigraphy","Covariance matrices;Heuristic algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Convolution;Adaptation models;Bayes methods;Probabilistic logic","","13","","33","IEEE","3 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
