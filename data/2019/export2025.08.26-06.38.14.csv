In certain applications, in addition to the inherent block-sparse structure of the signal, some prior information about the block support, i.e., blocks containing non-zero elements, might be available. Although many block-sparse recovery algorithms have been investigated in the Bayesian framework, it is still unclear how to incorporate the information about the probability of occurrence into regularization-based block-sparse recovery in an optimal sense. In this letter, we bridge between these fields by the aid of a new concept in conic integral geometry. Specifically, we solve a weighted optimization problem when the prior distribution about the block support is available. Moreover, we obtain the unique weights that minimize the expected required number of measurements. Our simulations on both synthetic and real data confirm that these weights considerably decrease the required sample complexity.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2897861","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8636201","Block sparse recovery;Bayesian information;conic integral geometry;convex optimization","Direction-of-arrival estimation;Mathematical model;Estimation;Bayes methods;Minimization;Optimization;Weight measurement","","7","","25","IEEE","6 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These compression artifacts are highly related to texture contents, and the hierarchical coding units decision structure also brings multi-scale similarity to these artifacts. Current loop filters fail to utilize these characteristics to comprehensively remove compression artifacts. To this end, this letter proposes a novel quality enhancement method by adopting a multi-reconstruction recurrent residual network (MRRN). In particular, a modified recursive residual structure is designed to capture the multi-scale similarity of compression artifact. To effectively enhance frames with uneven noise, a multi-reconstruction structure is proposed, which outputs images with different denoise ratios and adaptively fuses them. Experimental results show that the proposed MRRN can improve coding efficiency up to 15.1% compared with the original loop filter in high-efficiency video coding. Averagely, 6.7%, 7.8%, 7.6% BD-rate reduction is achieved for all intra, low-delay P, and low-delay B, respectively. Meanwhile, as a quality enhancement method performed at encoder side, MRRN also achieves a good balance between coding performance and computational complexity compared to the state-of-the-art methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2899253","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671282],61422111); Shanghai Pjiang Program(grant numbers:15pjd015); Shanghai Science and Technology Innovation Plan(grant numbers:18010500200); Shanghai Shuguang Program(grant numbers:17SG37); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8641373","Compression artifact reduction;CNN;recursive structure;HEVC;quality enhancement","Image reconstruction;Feature extraction;Training;Image coding;Encoding;Periodic structures;Compression algorithms","","28","","25","IEEE","13 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To enable the sparse MMW image recovery, the CS algorithm usually employs the popular ℓ2-norm as the data fidelity term and a combination of multiple sparsityinduced functions as the penalty term. The ℓ2-norm is non-robust against impulsive noise since the Gaussian noise distribution assumption is not valid, and the presence of impulsive noise will severely degrade the robustness of the compressive MMW image recovery. To gain more robustness performance, a complex correntropy based data-fitting term, namely complex correntropic loss (CC-loss), is used to replace the ℓ2-norm for the near-field MMW measurement contaminated by impulsive noise. In order to solve the corresponding minimization problem, an additive half quadratic method is used to transform the CC-loss term to its convex form, and then a parallel primal-dual process is used to guarantee the convergence of the proposed algorithm. In total, 150-GHz MMW experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve accurate image reconstruction from compressive measurements under different impulsive noise levels.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2892515","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61371049,61601096,61701095,61801089); Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2017GZ0335,2017GZ0338,2018GZ0224); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8610173","Millimeter-wave (MMW);compressed sensing (CS);impulsive noise;complex correntropy;half quadratic (HQ);parallel primal-dual algorithm","Image reconstruction;Image coding;Signal processing algorithms;TV;Two dimensional displays;Noise measurement;Pollution measurement","","3","","40","IEEE","11 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the estimation accuracy as compared with the existing works.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2902273","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61873345,61603328); Youth Talent Support Program of Hebei(grant numbers:BJ2018050); Teturned Overseas Chinese Scholar Foundation of Hebei(grant numbers:C201829); Open Project of Xiamen University(grant numbers:UAC201803); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8654653","Underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs);localization;synchronization;unscented transform","Transforms;Jacobian matrices;Clocks;Covariance matrices;Estimation;Signal processing algorithms;Computational modeling","","23","","16","IEEE","28 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a low-complexity iterative algorithm using approximate Bayesian inference based on the framework of generalized expectation consistent signal recovery to recover the symbol vector from nonlinear noisy measurements. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithm and approaches the symbol error rate limit of a genie detector in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, while the performance loss is very small in medium SNR. In particular, the complexity of proposed algorithm is quadratic, which makes it particularly suitable for large systems.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2902017","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61625106,61531011); Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(grant numbers:106-2221-E-110-019); ITRI in Hsinchu, Taiwan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8653960","Approximate Bayesian inference;massive MIMO;phase noise;symbol detection","Phase noise;Estimation;Approximation algorithms;Channel estimation;MIMO communication;Inference algorithms;Signal processing algorithms","","15","","15","IEEE","27 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the typical linear detectors such as zero forcing detector and minimum mean-square error detector are not optimal in terms of maximizing the achievable data rate of MIMO system under linear detection constraint. In this letter, we investigate the optimal linear transformer that can maximize such rate with finite constellation inputs. By capitalizing on the relationship between mutual information and the MMSE between channel inputs and outputs, the optimal linear detector (OLD) can be expressed as a fixed-point equation and be solved iteratively. Analytical results prove the consistence between the proposed OLD and the joint maximum likelihood detector (JMLD) in the low- and high-SNR region. The further simulation results verify the consistence, and moreover, at moderate SNR, OLD can significantly improve the achievable data rate and is close to that of JMLD.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2903376","BUPT Excellent Ph.D. Students Foundation(grant numbers:CX2018104); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8661602","Optimal linear detection;MIMO detection;mutual information;MMSE","MIMO communication;Detectors;Complexity theory;Signal processing algorithms;Convergence;Mutual information;Mathematical model","","4","","14","IEEE","6 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Simple solutions to the problem of extracting spatially encoded signals, necessary in virtual acoustics applications, result. In this letter, a simple time-domain representation of spatially encoded spherical harmonic signals is written directly in terms of spatial derivatives of the acoustic field at the receiver location. In a discrete setting, encoded signals may be obtained, at very low computational cost and latency, using local approximations with minimal number of grid points, and avoiding large convolutions and frequency-domain block processing of previous approaches. Numerical results illustrating receiver directivity and computed time-domain responses are presented, as well as numerical solution drift associated with repeated time integration.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2902509","H2020 European Research Council(grant numbers:ERC-2016-PoC-737574-WRAM); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8656507","Finite difference time domain (FDTD);room acoustics;spatial audio;microphone array;spherical harmonics;ambisonics","Time-domain analysis;Acoustics;Encoding;Harmonic analysis;Finite difference methods;Three-dimensional displays;Receivers","","12","","33","IEEE","1 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These methods can analyze the statistical feature distribution of a large number of training samples, and then generate steganographic texts that conform to such statistical distribution. For these steganography methods, previous steganalysis methods show unsatisfactory detection performance, which remains an unsolved problem and poses a great threat to the security of cyberspace. In this letter, we proposed a fast and efficient text steganalysis method to solve this problem. We first analyzed the correlations between words in these generated steganographic texts. Then, we map each word to a semantic space and used a hidden layer to extract the correlations between these words. Finally, based on the extracted correlation features, we used the softmax classifier to classify the input text. Experimental results show that the proposed model can achieve a high detection accuracy, which shows a state-of-the-art performance.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2902095","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:SQ2018YGX210002); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1536207,U1705261,U1636113); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8653856","Text steganography;text steganalysis;word embedding;word correlation","Correlation;Semantics;Feature extraction;Training;Statistical distributions;Dictionaries;Neural networks","","69","","14","IEEE","27 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This learning-based method deals with wideband DOA estimation by treating it as a function approximation issue. The proposed approach first decomposes the wideband array outputs into several narrowband components, then approximates the functional relationship between the decomposed narrowband data and the DOA with coherent SVR scheme through training. The trained function is then capable of estimating the DOA when wideband signal with unknown impinging direction arrives. We prove the effectiveness and superiority of the presented method by simulation experiments. Simulation results show that the new technique has a better performance in terms of estimation errors than the conventional broadband DOA estimation method, especially in demanding scenarios with low SNR and limited snapshots. Moreover, the proposed approach also relaxes the unambiguous array element-spacing restrictions, i.e., it has extended the frequency range of wideband signals where direction finding without angle ambiguity is achievable.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2901641","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61072120,60802053); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8651542","Wideband DOA estimation;machine learning;coherent support vector regression","Direction-of-arrival estimation;Wideband;Estimation;Training;Correlation;Narrowband;Machine learning","","69","","25","IEEE","24 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
