A second-order autoregressive [AR(2)] model with the Kalman filter is used to estimate the channel gain of the global multihop channel. The parameters of the AR(2) model can be tuned by using a classic correlation matching criterion. Alternatively, the use of a minimization of the asymptotic variance criterion permits a strong performance improvement, although the corresponding analytical study is still missing in the literature—which is the topic of this letter. The closed-form expressions for the optimal tuning of the AR(2) parameters and mean square error performance have been first established as a function of the second and fourth moments of the Doppler spectrum of the global channel. Because the analytical formulas of these moments were not given in the literature, we derive them by exploiting cumulant property of convolution of density functions, after decomposition of the global channel as a cascade of Jakes Doppler power spectral density channels. Consequently, the provided closed-form formula are helpful for the design of Kalman filters for a given state of the source, destination, and mobile relays [Doppler spread and signal to noise ratio].","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2904439","European Commission; European Regional Development Fund; French state; Hauts de France Region Council(grant numbers:ELSAT2020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8664609","Channel estimation;autoregressive model;Jakes’ Doppler;Kalman filter;mobile-to-mobile;relay networks","Doppler effect;Relays;Correlation;Kalman filters;Channel estimation;Mathematical model;Fading channels","","4","","17","IEEE","10 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this problem, in this letter, we propose a strategy for accelerating the multiway greedy reconstruction. The proposed strategy allows all supports to be updated in an iteration such that an over-estimated greedy solution can be obtained through only a few iterations, and the superfluous indexes of each support are removed in subsequent iterations. The computational complexity of the proposed strategy is significantly reduced, comparing to that of the standard multiway greedy algorithm.

In contrast, the subject-independent scenario, where a well trained model can be directly applied to new users without precalibration, is particularly desired. Considering this critical gap, the focus in this letter is developing an effective EEG signal analysis adaptively applied to subject-independent settings. We present a convolutional recurrent attention model (CRAM) that utilizes a convolutional neural network to encode the high-level representation of EEG signals and a recurrent attention mechanism to explore the temporal dynamics of the EEG signals as well as to focus on the most discriminative temporal periods.

In this letter, a framework is developed, which allows one to answer these questions. This is achieved by generalizing the maximum margin principle to maximum margin partition and proposing a generic solution, morphMedian, resulting in the maximum margin principle. It is then shown that watersheds form a particular class of morphMedian classifiers. Using the ensemble technique, watersheds are also extended to ensemble watersheds.

As a result, it provides high-resolution directional response with low computational complexity. We show that a robust DU beamformer can be implemented by subtracting the largest eigenvalue of the estimated covariance matrix from the diagonal elements, and that this implementation is valid in general (i.e., for both the single-source and the multiple-source case). We propose the use of the power method for the estimation of the largest eigenvalue in the DU procedure.

However, sparsification is still required in the KCG algorithms to curb the growth of network structure for online applications. To address this issue, a novel online random Fourier features conjugate gradient (RFFCG) algorithm based on the minimum mean-square error criterion is proposed by approximating the kernel with the random Fourier features. With no requirement of sparsification, the proposed RFFCG significantly reduces the computational and storage complexities in KAFs. Meanwhile, the RFFCG efficiently uses only one error in the loss function to approach the filtering accuracy of the KAF with sparsification based on all the errors in the loss function. Monte Carlo simulations on short-term chaotic time-series prediction validate the superiorities of the proposed RFFCG algorithm.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2907480","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671389); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:XDJK2019B011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8678806","Stochastic gradient descent;kernel conjugate gradient;random Fourier features;complexity;short-term chaotic time-series prediction","Signal processing algorithms;Kernel;Convergence;Prediction algorithms;Complexity theory;Approximation algorithms;Mean square error methods","","27","","24","IEEE","31 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To learn similarity-preserving hash function, most existing methods are designed for the centralized setting. However, the current data storage systems are distributed to increase scalability. Obviously, it is infeasible to aggregate all the data into a fusion center because of the prohibitively expensive communication and computation overhead. Motivated by this, some methods are proposed to achieve hashing for distributed data. However, these methods mostly focus on extending one specific hashing to a distributed model without considering the generality. In this letter, we propose a novel general distributed hash learning model, which can be viewed as an effective distributed model of most hashing methods. The proposed model can achieve up to 15.2% accuracy gains over state-of-the-art distributed hashing methods, while the communication cost is independent on the data size.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2907777","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772112,61672379,61602226); Dalian High-level Talent Innovation Program(grant numbers:2015R049); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8675499","Image retrieval;hash;distributed data","Hash functions;Hamming distance;Computational complexity;Binary codes;Training;Distributed databases;Computational modeling","","9","","29","IEEE","27 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed fractional derivative formulation allows for the definition of predictor with versatile behavior based on the order of fractional derivative. We derive the closed-form expressions of the optimal fractional linear predictor with restricted memory, and prove that the optimal first-order and the optimal second-order linear predictors are only its special cases. Furthermore, we empirically prove that the optimal order of fractional derivative can be approximated by the inverse of the predictor memory, and thus, it is a priori known. Therefore, the complexity is reduced by optimizing and transferring only one predictor coefficient, i.e., one parameter less in comparison to the second-order linear predictor, at the same level of performance.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2908278","Agentúra na Podporu Výskumu a Vývoja(grant numbers:SK-SRB-18-0011,SK-AT-2017-0015,APVV-14-0892); Slovak Grant Agency for Science(grant numbers:VEGA 1/0365/19); Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development; Republic of Serbia(grant numbers:337-00-107/2019-09/11,TR33037); COST Action(grant numbers:CA15225); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8676355","Fractional calculus;linear prediction;restricted memory;speech processing","Predictive models;Speech processing;Correlation;Speech coding;Frequency-domain analysis;Closed-form solutions","","11","","25","IEEE","29 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

BS is an ensemble method using multiple base predictions (MBPs) for better final prediction. Because of the necessity for MBPs, the computational cost and model size of BS-based methods are greater than those of a single model. In overcoming this, TSN first obtains MBPs from a single deep neural network. Then, to obtain better final prediction, the convolution layers of TSN aggregate not only MBPs but also some auxiliary information such as contextual information, while adaptively filtering out some unnecessary information, e.g., poor base predictions. At the training phase, the MOL enables all stages of TSN to learn jointly, whereas allowing the TSN framework to embed a BS. Our experimental results confirm that the embedded BS leads TSN to outperform other baseline methods with a reasonably low computational cost and model size.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2905660","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:2017R1A2B4011357); Ministry of Science; H2020 LEIT Information and Communication Technologies; Future Planning; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8668449","Speech enhancement;two-stage network","Convolution;Feature extraction;Training;Artificial neural networks;Noise measurement;Speech enhancement;Computational efficiency","","14","","33","IEEE","17 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Beyond the proposed scheme, we move forward to optimize the signal processing design of the F3D node with the target of maximizing the secrecy capacity. The formulated optimization problem is nonconvex and challenging to deal with. We then design an iterative algorithm based on generalized fractional programming to solve it. One key step in the iterative algorithm involves another nonconvex optimization and we decompose it into a two-level optimization.
