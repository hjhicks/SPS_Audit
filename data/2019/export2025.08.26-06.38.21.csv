The optimization in this method consists of a simultaneous minimization of two objective functions, resulting in a bilevel optimization problem with SNMF (BiSNMF), where conventional methods approximately solve this optimization. To strictly solve BiSNMF, we introduce a new algorithm with the following two features: (a) conversion of the optimization constraint into a penalty term and (b) optimization of the reformulated problem on the basis of a multiplicative steepest descent, ensuring the nonnegativity of variables.

We show that this condition on A implies something much stronger: that an unknown vector x can be recovered from measurements y = TAx, when the unknown T belongs to an arbitrary set of invertible, diagonalizable linear transformations T. The set T can be finite or countably infinite. When it is the set of m × m permutation matrices, we have the classical unlabeled sampling problem.

One popular approach to exploit the difference coarray model is to construct an augmented covariance matrix from the sample covariance matrix. By applying common direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation algorithms to this augmented covariance matrix, more sources than the number of sensors can be identified. In this letter, inspired by the optimal transport theory, we develop a new approach to construct this augmented covariance matrix. We formulate a structured covariance estimation problem that minimizes the Bures-Wasserstein distance between the sample covariance matrix and the subsampled augmented covariance matrix, which can be either casted to a semi-definite programming problem, or directly solved using gradient-based methods.

In this letter, different from the existing iterative methods that address the problem of nonuniform noise, a non-iterative two-phase subspace-based DOA estimation method is proposed. The first phase of the method is based on estimating the noise subspace via eigendecomposition (ED) of some properly designed matrix and it avoids estimating the noise covariance matrix. In the second phase, the results achieved in the first phase are used to estimate the noise covariance matrix, followed by estimating the noise subspace via generalized ED.

By leveraging such convergence, simple approximations for both the CDF and PDF of the target variable are given in terms of the derivatives of its moment generating function (MGF). In contrast to classical approximation methods based on truncated series of moments or cumulants, our approximations always represent a valid distribution and the relative error between variables is independent of the variable under analysis.
