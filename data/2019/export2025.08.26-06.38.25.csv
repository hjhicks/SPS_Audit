With analysis, it is shown that, under mild conditions the one-bit covariance matrix can be approximated by the sum of a scaled unquantized covariance matrix and a scaled identity matrix. Although the scaling parameters are unknown because of the extreme quantization, they do not affect the subspace-based DOA estimators. Specifically, the signal and noise subspaces can be straightforwardly determined through the eigendecomposition of the one-bit covariance matrix, without pre-processing such as unquantized covariance matrix reconstruction. With so-obtained subspaces, the most classical multiple signal classification (MUSIC) technique can be applied to determine the signal DOAs. The resulting method is thus termed as one-bit MUSIC. Thanks to the simplicity of this method, it can be very easily implemented in practical applications, whereas the DOA estimation performance is comparable to the case with unquantized covariance matrix reconstruction, as demonstrated by various simulations.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2913452","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771316); Foundation of Guangdong Science and Technology Department(grant numbers:2017A030313341); Foundation of Shenzhen(grant numbers:JCYJ20170302150044331); Guangdong Special Support Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8700277","One-bit quantization;direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation;multiple signal classification (MUSIC)","Covariance matrices;Multiple signal classification;Direction-of-arrival estimation;Estimation;Signal to noise ratio;Quantization (signal);Manganese","","100","","21","IEEE","26 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the MMSE module, exploiting the fact that the likelihood is only a function of the absolute value of z, the magnitude and phase information of z are decoupled, and only the posterior means and variances of the magnitude of z are calculated.

Impulsive noise is a common impediment in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based communication systems for industry applications. This non-Gaussian noise degrades the performance of conventional equalizers and, hence, elicit a modified version of the equalizer that fits the non-Gaussian description of the noise. This letter proposes a nonlinear minimum mean square error equalizer for OFDM systems where the characteristics of the added noise to the system is known. The soft values were obtained based on the derivation of the equalizer for a memory-less channel impaired with impulsive noise. Obtaining such values are required for the implementation of a turbo-equalization scheme. The validity of such an equalizer is tested through simulations and the result of simulations shows that the nonlinear equalizer is successful in combating the effect of an impulsive noise. Thus, the turbo-coded OFDM system shows a significant boost at low signal-to-noise ratios.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2917018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8715434","Impulsive noise;minimum mean square error;nonlinear filters","Equalizers;OFDM;Decoding;Covariance matrices;Communication systems;Time-domain analysis;Frequency-domain analysis","","10","","33","IEEE","15 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While it is a challenging task to carry out differential-modulation-assisted non-coherent detection for multi-carrier transmissions in the presence of a severe inter-carrier interference (ICI), in the proposed scheme ICI elimination and symbol demodulation are implemented in a non-coherent manner, by exploiting the fact that ICI imposed by D-SEFDM is deterministically given, once we have a compression factor of non-orthogonal subcarriers. It is verified in our simulations that the proposed D-SEFDM exhibits a higher performance than the conventional coherent SEFDM scheme, especially for the scenarios of a high Doppler frequency.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2918688","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:16KK0120,17H03259,17K18871); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8721548","Differential modulation;multicarrier;interference;non-orthogonal subcarriers;OFDM;SEFDM","OFDM;Phase shift keying;Receivers;Frequency division multiplexing;Frequency modulation;Bandwidth;Fading channels","","8","","17","IEEE","24 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An effective extension of these methods is considered here that incorporates multiple spatially separated dual-polarized antennas. Correlations in polarization-frequency responses, space-frequency responses, and hybrid combinations are leveraged to associate FH signals. The extended method is investigated using empirically informed simulations and over-the-air experiments to illustrate the efficacy of the approach. The over-the-air experiments involved four FH signals in a laboratory environment. A two-second interval was collected involving 2000 frequency hopping dwells. Results for a single manifold were found to experience misassociation errors, even at high SNR, due to similarities between polarization-frequency responses associated with the sources. When all manifolds are exploited, perfect association is achieved over the interval. Similar trends occur at low SNR, where increasing the number of available manifolds improves misassociation rates. It is concluded that additional diversities provided by a space-polarization architecture improve association performance.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2918939","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-15-1-2057); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8721555","Blind signal separation;polarization mode dispersion;signal classification;frequency hopping;space-polarization","Manifolds;Receivers;Signal to noise ratio;Dispersion;Frequency synchronization;Antenna arrays;Indexes","","3","","18","IEEE","24 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, it is of great significance to study how to reduce the number of the ensemble classifiers under the premise of ensuring the classification performance. In this letter, we propose a selective ensemble method in image steganalysis based on deep Q network, which combines reinforcement learning with convolutional neural network and are seldom seen in ensemble pruning. This method improves the generalization performance of the model, and reduces the size of ensemble as well.

Recently, two different techniques suggested to mitigate this deficiency, i.e., enjoy the advantages of deep learning without being restricted by the training phase. The first one follows the plug-and-play (P&P) approach that solves general inverse problems (e.g., SR) by using Gaussian denoisers for handling the prior term in model-based optimization schemes. The second builds on internal recurrence of information inside a single image, and trains a super-resolver network at test time on examples synthesized from the low-resolution image. Our letter incorporates these two independent strategies, enjoying the impressive generalization capabilities of deep learning, captured by the first, and further improving it through internal learning at test time. First, we apply a recent P&P strategy to SR. Then, we show how it may become image-adaptive in test time. This technique outperforms the above two strategies on popular datasets and gives better results than other state-of-the-art methods in practical cases where the observation model is inexact or unknown in advance.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2920250","H2020 European Research Council(grant numbers:ERC StG 757497 PI); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8727404","Deep learning;image super-resolution;internal learning;denoising neural network;plug-and-play","Training;Image resolution;Deep learning;Signal resolution;Noise reduction;Optimization;Kernel","","55","","35","IEEE","31 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These methods usually assume that individual decision agents are conditionally independent, an assumption that might not hold in practical setups. Therefore, in this work we formulate and solve the decision-making problem using an EM-based approach, but assuming correlated decision agents.

Our main result is a sufficient condition on the network structure and available label information such that nLasso accurately learns a localized linear regression model from a few labeled data points.
