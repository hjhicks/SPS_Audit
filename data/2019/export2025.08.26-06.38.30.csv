However, existing methods that transport the common information from a prior frame to the current frame do not make use of the common information effectively. In order to address this issue, we apply a new strategy that jointly segments object through a convolutional neural network (CNN) to build a proposal-driven framework for exploiting the common information between two video frames by processing two video frames simultaneously in this letter. Moreover, proposals from the video frames are found useful for refining the segmentation results through fusing their segmentation results with the ones of the video frames. In our framework, proposals with features are generated by a faster region-CNN, and the L2 loss function is used to establish proposal pairs among proposals from the two selected frames. A new trained ResNet then keeps proposal pairs, which contain the same content, and the PSPNet model for segmentation is utilized to generate the segmentation results belonging to the frames and proposals. Finally, the proposals' segmentation results are refined using the video frames' segmentation results. The VOT 2016 segmentation dataset, the DAVIS 2017 dataset, and the SegTrack v2 dataset were used for training and testing our framework. Experimental results show that our proposal-driven segmentation framework is able to achieve higher accuracies in video segmentation challenge compared to those of the existing video segmentation methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2921654","Science and Technology Development Fund of Macao SAR(grant numbers:0027/2018/A1); Faculty Research Grant of Macau University of Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8733114","Segmentation;proposals;convolutional neural network (CNN)","Proposals;Videos;Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Training;Data mining;Convolutional neural networks","","10","","43","IEEE","10 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This letter proposes an epoch extraction method that can accurately extract epochs from clean as well as telephonic speech signals. In the proposed method, the significant impulse-like discontinuities are extracted directly from the speech signal using continuous wavelet transform. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using three speakers, namely, SLT, BDL, and JMK from CMU Arctic database. The clean speech is simulated using G.191 software tools to obtain telephonic speech.

In addition, the lower signaling efficiency of side information occurs when a successive binary split in the same direction is selected. Motivated by these observations, the derived mode (DM) based on QTBT is proposed in this letter, where six novel DMs are introduced. The DM further splits a QTBT node into several sub-blocks, and each sub-block can be predicted independently. Among the DMs, four asymmetrical split modes are introduced to improve the capability of coding asymmetrical motion, and two 4-split modes are designed to improve signaling efficiency.

Instead of considering a traditional setup where the observations correspond to the signal values at a subset of nodes, here the observations are obtained locally at a single node via the successive aggregation of its own value and that of its neighbors.

In our approach, we first apply a stitching algorithm to construct a map of an inspected area assuming that a drone is flying at the same altitude by trajectory close to meander, so that each frame can have a partial overlap with other frame captured much earlier or later. Then, we extract position and rotation angle within the map for each frame and use them as a side information for the video coding. In order to compress an input video sequence, we utilize a multi-view H.265/HEVC with two views. First view is a virtual view generated utilizing the decoded frames of the second view and the side information, whereas the input video is considered as the second view, which is encoded utilizing the virtual view as a reference for the inter-view prediction. The proposed approach has two main benefits. First, the aerial map is generated during decoding utilizing the side information, i.e., the map is not embedded into a bit stream. Second, the inter-view prediction allows to exploit an additional redundancy, which is typical for a drone video. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm provides 1.4%-2.4% bit rate savings comparing to H.265/HEVC. The maximum possible bit rate savings are estimated from 15.5% to 18.9% assuming that the drone is repeatedly flying many times at exactly the same trajectory.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2921250","Government of the Russian Federation through the ITMO Fellowship and Professorship Program; Danish energy technological development and demonstration program(grant numbers:EUDP 15-I,64015-0072); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8733128","Infrared video;video coding;H.265/HEVC","Drones;Encoding;Video sequences;Signal processing algorithms;Bit rate;Inspection;Video coding","","10","","19","IEEE","10 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This ‚Äúlinear-like‚Äù regression form also allows us to resort to the UMV state estimation framework for the development of new nonlinear filter to handle unknown inputs. Specifically, two approaches have been developed: 1) given the estimated inputs, we derive a filter by minimizing the trace of the state error covariance matrix; 2) without input estimation, we derive the filter by minimizing the trace of the state error covariance matrix subject to a constraint imposed on the gain matrix.

For Œî = ‚àû, the celebrated Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem guarantees that perfect recovery is possible, provided that the sampling rate 1/Ts exceeds the so-called Nyquist rate. Recent work by Bhandari et al. has shown that for any Œî > 0 perfect reconstruction is still possible, if the sampling rate exceeds the Nyquist rate by a factor of ire. In this letter, we improve upon this result and show that for finite energy signals, perfect recovery is possible for any Œî > 0 and any sampling rate above the Nyquist rate. Thus, modulo folding does not degrade the signal, provided that the sampling rate exceeds the Nyquist rate. This claim is proved by establishing a connection between the recovery problem of a discrete-time signal from its modulo reduced version and the problem of predicting the next sample of a discrete-time signal from its past, and leveraging the fact that for a bandlimited signal the prediction error can be made arbitrarily small.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2923835","ISF(grant numbers:1791/17); GENESIS Consortium via the Israel Ministry of Economy and Industry; ISF(grant numbers:1523/16); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8741089","Chebyshev polynomials;modulo ADC;prediction;sampling;unlimited sampling","Quantization (signal);Fourier transforms;Image reconstruction;Signal processing algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Frequency response;Dynamic range","","49","","17","IEEE","19 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thereafter, to maximize the realistic transmit beamforming gains, a novel precoder design is derived that accounts for the underlying IQI for maximizing received power in both single and multiuser settings. Finally, the simulation results, demonstrating a significant -8 dB improvement in the mean squared error of the proposed LSE over existing benchmarks, show that the optimal precoder designing is more critical than accurately estimating IQI-impaired channels.

It degrades the image quality and affects the subsequent analyses on the image. Traditional single-image based reflection removal methods assume the reflection is blurry. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are, then, used to identify the blurry reflection and remove it. However, it is often that the blurry reflection still contains strong edges. They will be treated as the background and kept in the image. In this letter, we propose a novel two-stage DNN based reflection removal algorithm. In the first stage, we include a new feature reduction term in the loss function when training the network. Due to its strong reflection suppression ability, the reflection components in the image can be more effectively suppressed. However, it will also attenuate the gradient values of the background image. For recovering the background, in the second stage, we first estimate a reflection gradient confidence map based on the initial estimation result and use it to identify the strong background gradients. Then, we use a generative adversarial network to reconstruct the background image from its gradients. Experimental results show that the proposed two-stage approach can give a superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art DNN based methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2926828","The Hong Kong Polytechnic University(grant numbers:RU9P); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8755471","Image reflection removal;blind image separation;deep neural network","Estimation;Neural networks;Training;Generative adversarial networks;Image reconstruction;Erbium;Image edge detection","","15","","20","IEEE","4 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our framework makes it possible to utilize well-known exact or approximate Bayesian filters, such as Kalman or extended Kalman filters, to solve large-scale regularized optimization problems.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2926926","Lloyds Register Foundation programme on Data Centric Engineering through the London Air Quality project; Alan Turing Institute for Data Science and AI under EPSRC(grant numbers:EP/N510129/1); Agence Nationale de la Recherche of France under PISCES(grant numbers:ANR-17-CE40-0031-01,ANR-17-CE40-0004-01); Spanish Agencia Estatal de Investigaci√≥n(grant numbers:TEC2015-69868-C2-1-R); Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-19-1-2226); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8755451","Probabilistic optimization;stochastic gradient;proximal algorithms;extended Kalman filtering","Kalman filters;Probabilistic logic;Cost function;Gradient methods;Signal processing algorithms;Bayes methods","","4","","28","IEEE","4 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
