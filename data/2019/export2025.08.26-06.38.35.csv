Each sensor can possibly sense only a subset of the parameters, gather data only about these parameters, and has access to only the statistical model of the data that it collects locally. The objective is that each sensor forms optimal estimates for its designated parameters (i.e., the parameters that it can sense). This letter proposes an estimation cost function that strikes a balance between the sensors being autonomous in forming local estimates based on their locally available data and statistical models, and enforcing consistency among the local estimates formed for the parameters that are sensed by multiple sensors. Exact optimal estimators are characterized, and it is shown that the optimal estimators can be implemented in a distributed way, through a single-shot exchange of local decisions. Specifically, the distributed implementation consists of forming local estimates and exchanging certain sufficient statistics values in a single round of communication exchange among some of the sensors. Furthermore, the optimal performance under the proposed cost function is also compared analytically with the performance of the widely used mean squared error estimator.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2925539","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-1554482,DMS-1737976); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8747440","Autonomous systems;distributed algorithm;estimation theory;networks","Sensors","","","","21","IEEE","27 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Besides, the scalability to larger or color image dehashing is limited in the previous dehashing network. To this end, we propose a pyramidal long-range residual-learning network (PyLRR-Net).

We thus introduce kernel learning to model the nonlinear structure of complex data distribution. Moreover, the model is further reformulated in an online setting to address the streaming videos. The high retraining cost and large memory requirement of MMED are thus significantly reduced. In addition, we employ AlexNet architecture to make further comparison with mid-level features.

To this end, we introduce novel complex and quaternion valued complementary quadratic cost functions for complex and quaternion signal estimation, which are extensions of the recently proposed complementary MSE metric. It is shown that for WL minimum MSE estimation and least squares regression, the complementary cost function and the standard cost function attain the same stationary point.

The majority of previously utilized SCE methods have relied on heuristic digital signal processing (DSP) methods, and only a small number of bi-directional long short-term memory (BLSTM) approaches have made use of modern machine learning approaches in the SCE task. This letter presents a novel end-to-end method called SylNet for automatic syllable counting from speech, built on the basis of a recent developments in neural network architectures. We describe how the entire model can be optimized directly to minimize SCE error on the training data without annotations aligned at the syllable level, and how it can be adapted to new languages using limited speech data with known syllable counts. Experiments on several different languages reveal that SylNet generalizes to languages beyond its training data and further improves with adaptation. It also outperforms several previously proposed methods for syllabification, including end-to-end BLSTMs.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2929415","Academy of Finland(grant numbers:312105,314602); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8769944","syllable count estimation;end-to-end learning;deep learning;speech processing","Estimation;Training;Adaptation models;Speech processing;Signal processing algorithms;Training data;Channel estimation","","6","","29","IEEE","23 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the SAR can only be used to classify surface ships without any underwater target. In contrast, since sonar can receive radiated noises from both vessels and underwater targets, its images can be used to effectively identify targets at different depths. However, due to the shortage of underwater target data and the difficulty in modeling, sonar images are hardly used for deep learning (DL). To solve such problems, this letter proposes a compound convolutional neural network (CSDN) based on a shared latent sparse feature (SLS) and a deep belief network (DBN) to learn striation-based sonar images. This letter has three contributions. First, this letter uses striation images to overcome the lack of training data for CNNs. Second, the DBN is applied to optimize fuzzy or discontinuous fringes, and an SLS feature is proposed to represent the interference fringe. Finally, the two features are exploited to separately train CNNs, combined with weight, to enhance the accuracy of classifying water targets. The experimental results indicate that, compared with the other DL-based models-VGG, SSD, RFCN, and SCDAE-a CSDN is more stable for different datasets and has the highest accuracy of up to 93.34%.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2919102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8723113","Striation;neural network;sonar images","Interference;Sonar;Training;Synthetic aperture radar;Optimization;Deep learning;Sea surface","","28","","26","IEEE","27 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, selecting appropriate reference audio (RA) signals to extract emotion embedding vectors to the specific types of target emotions remains problematic. To ameliorate the selection problem, we propose an effective way of generating emotion embedding vectors by utilizing the trained GSTs. By assuming that the trained GSTs represent an emotional vector space, we first investigate the distribution of all the training samples depending on the type of each emotion. We then regard the centroid of the distribution as an emotion-specific weighting value, which effectively controls the expressiveness of synthesized speech, even without using the RA for guidance, as it did before. Finally, we confirm that the proposed controlled weight-based method is superior to the conventional emotion label-based methods in terms of perceptual quality and emotion classification accuracy.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2931673","Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion (IITP); Korea government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2019-0-00447); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8778667","Emotional speech synthesis;end-to-end;text-to-speech;global style token;emotional vector space;emotion weight values","Speech synthesis;Spectrogram;Training;Decoding;Aerospace electronics;Acoustics;Vocoders","","32","","29","IEEE","29 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In constrained parameter estimation, the estimator is usually required to satisfy the constraints. However, the LU-CCRB is a lower bound for Lehmann-unbiased estimators that do not necessarily satisfy the constraints. In this letter, we consider the norm constraint and derive a novel bound, called norm-constrained CCRB (NC-CCRB), which is a lower bound on the mean-squared-error matrix trace of Lehmann-unbiased estimators that satisfy the norm constraint. The NC-CCRB is shown to be tighter than the LU-CCRB.

By optimizing the beamformer output variances as well as the filter alternately with iterative update rules, and also by using the moving average of output powers at adjacent frames for robust estimation of an output variance, the MLDR beamformer may minimize the power of a relatively accurate noise component at the output, which resulted in better recognition performance than conventional beamformers. In addition, it can be further improved by initializing the output variances to averaged powers of a neural-network(NN)-masked input signal to estimate target speech powers, which achieved even better performance than compared beamformers exploiting trained NNs.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2932848","Ministry of Trade, Industry, & Energy, Korea under the Industrial Technology Innovation Program(grant numbers:10063424); National Research Foundation of Korea; Korea government(grant numbers:NRF-2017R1A2B4009964); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8786175","Beamforming;maximum-likelihood estimation;complex Gaussian distribution;robust speech recognition","Covariance matrices;Array signal processing;Speech recognition;Maximum likelihood estimation;Artificial neural networks;Microphones","","28","","39","IEEE","5 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The reference is computed by combining the details and saliency of the initial image with uniform gray image that assures a balanced chromatic distribution.
