"Open Vocabulary Arabic Diacritics Restoration","Y.

When diacritics are present, the phonetic transcription algorithm can be implemented based on a few rules. Restoring Arabic diacritics based on language model scoring is the dominant approach. A fixed vocabulary is usually used to build the language model used for scoring. Since Arabic is a morphologically rich language, the number of the Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words is large and the diacritization algorithm fails to restore diacritics for these words. In this letter, we present a novel approach to support open vocabulary diacritics restoration based on the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) method. The BPE method segments the words into variable length sub-word units and allows open vocabulary from fixed sub-word units dictionary. On the Tashkeela diacritization task, this open vocabulary approach outperforms the word and character based methods commonly used in the literature.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2933721","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8790761","Language model scoring;dynamic programming search;byte pair encoding;arabic diacritics restoration","Vocabulary;Dictionaries;Signal processing algorithms;Training;Heuristic algorithms;Syntactics;Dynamic programming","","9","","39","IEEE","7 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compressive privacy (CP) is a kind of privacy-preserving dimension-reduced projection schemes such that the projected data can be well used for the intended utility task but not for malicious applications. Nevertheless, most of existing CP approaches belong to centralized processing, which are not applicable to the cases that data is dispersedly collected/stored at distributed nodes and cannot be centralized to one node for processing due to various reasons. To tackle this problem, we propose a distributed differential utility/cost analysis (dDUCA), in which each node in the network is only allowed to exchange and combine the compressive-and-lossy projection matrix with its one-hop neighbors. Using the projection matrix, the classification of the projected data is performed.

Uncached requested files can be transferred from the cloud to the eRRHs by following either backhaul or fronthaul modes. The backhaul mode transfers fractions of the requested files, while the fronthaul mode transmits quantized baseband samples as in Cloud-RAN (C-RAN). The backhaul mode allows the caches of the eRRHs to be updated, which may lower future delivery latencies. In contrast, the fronthaul mode enables cooperative C-RAN transmissions that may reduce the current delivery latency. Taking into account the trade-off between current and future delivery performance, this letter proposes an adaptive selection method between the two delivery modes to minimize the long-term delivery latency.

Although this problem is non-convex and difficult to solve in general, we obtain the optimal solution by decoupling the positioning optimization and power control. The optimal solution shows that if the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) $\rho$ is high, then the two users should take turns to transmit at the maximum power in an on-off manner and each UAV is positioned exactly above the associated user. By contrast, if $\rho$ is low and/or the two users’ distance $D$ is large, then the two users should transmit simultaneously at the maximum power, and each UAV should be positioned away from the two users for interference mitigation.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2934579","Nature Science Foundation of Southwest University of Science and Technology(grant numbers:18zx7142); Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871137); Guangdong Province Key Area R&D Program(grant numbers:2018B030338001); National Key Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1800800); Open Research Fund of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University(grant numbers:2019D08); Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2019JDTD0019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8805392","Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV);three-dimensional (3D) positioning optimization;interference channel;sum-rate maximization;power control","Optimization;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Signal to noise ratio;Interference channels;Power control;Channel models","","28","","14","IEEE","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Usually, PolSAR image features are extracted by various methods, and their divergence is very significant. In the data representation based methods, the feature divergence is ignored in the distance metric, thus the different features have the same metric contributions. In this letter, we propose a robust weighting nearest regularized subspace (NRS) method, which introduces the robust statistics to construct the weights of distance metric according to the feature divergence. This method can increase the representation ability of the training samples by the weighted calculation of the biasing Tikhonov matrix.

We exploit extended support estimate $\mathcal {E}$ with size larger than $k$ satisfying $\mathcal {E} \supseteq \mathcal {T}$ and obtained by a trained deep neural network (DNN). To make the DNN learnable, it provides $\mathcal {E}$ as the union of equivalent solutions of $\mathcal {T}$ by utilizing modulo Fourier invariances. Set $\mathcal {E}$ can be estimated with short running time via the DNN, and support $\mathcal {T}$ can be determined from the DNN output rather than from the full index set by applying hard thresholding to $\mathcal {E}$. Thus, the DNN-based extended support estimation improves the reconstruction performance of the signal with a low complexity burden dependent on $k$. Numerical results verify that the proposed scheme has a superior performance with lower complexity compared to local search-based greedy sparse phase retrieval and a state-of-the-art variant of the Fienup method.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2935814","ICT R&D Program of MSIP/IITP(grant numbers:2016-0-00563); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8805169","Deep neural network;extended support estimation;Fourier transform;sparse phase retrieval","Indexes;Estimation;Complexity theory;Training;Neural networks;Fourier transforms;Noise measurement","","7","","20","IEEE","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, we focus on retinal vessel segmentation which is an important and challenging problem among others. Many retinal vessel segmentation algorithms have been developed, where most of them rely on the filtering technique. However, the available filters suffer from undesirable responses at some vessel and non-vessel structures. Thus, we propose a new framework based on optimal adaptive filters for retinal vessel segmentation. The filter coefficients are obtained by solving multiple inverse problems under a regularization framework. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on fundus images from the DRIVE and STARE datasets. In the experimental section, we show that the proposed framework outperforms all of the compared methods in four indicators namely sensitivity, F1-score, G-mean and Mathews correlation coefficient.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2938631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8821374","Retinal vessel segmentation;filamentary structures;optimal adaptive filters;inverse problem;regularization","Image segmentation;Training;Retinal vessels;Blood vessels;Biomedical imaging;Image reconstruction","","11","","22","IEEE","30 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This letter considers the joint optimization of constant modulus waveforms and mismatched (or matched) receive filters to suppress the auto- and cross correlations using the minimax (ℓ∞-norm) design criterion. For practical waveform length and system size, the waveform design problem becomes quite challenging due to the large problem size (more than IO5 unimodular complex variables and IO7 nonlinear constraints). In addition to the large size, this problem is nonconvex, nonsmooth, and as such, cannot be handled effectively by the existing waveform design algorithms or off-the-shelve optimization tools. This letter develops an efficient primal-dual type algorithm with low per-iteration complexity to solve this problem. Numerical comparison shows that the waveforms based on the minimax design outperform those obtained from the existing ℓ2-norm design by 4-5 dBs in terms of peak sidelobe levels.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2926020","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571384,61731018); Leading Talents of Guangdong Province Program(grant numbers:00201501); Development and Reform Commission of Shenzhen Municipality; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8752009","MIMO system;mismatched (or matched) filters;unimodular waveforms;auto-/cross-correlation;primal-dual method","MIMO communication;Signal processing algorithms;Optimization;Correlation;Minimization;Two dimensional displays;Sensors","","22","","29","IEEE","1 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the traditional blind deblurring methods based on blur kernel estimation do not perform well on complicated non-uniform motion blurs. However, recent studies show that GAN-based approaches achieve impressive performance on deblurring tasks. In this letter, to further improve the performance of GAN-based methods on deblurring tasks, we propose an edge heuristic multi-scale generative adversarial network (GAN), which uses the coarse-to-fine scheme to restore clear images in an end-to-end manner. In particular, an edge-generated network is designed to generate sharp edges as auxiliary information to guide the deblurring process. Furthermore, We propose a hierarchical content loss function for deblurring tasks. Extensive experiments on different datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in dynamic scene deblurring.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2939752","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61572068,61532005); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(grant numbers:2019YJS048,2019JBM018); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8825566","Blind image deblurring;generative adversarial network;edge heuristic","Image edge detection;Gallium nitride;Generators;Kernel;Task analysis;Image restoration;Generative adversarial networks","","34","","37","IEEE","5 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the PMF takes the form of a multi-way tensor, under certain model assumptions the problem becomes closely associated with tensor factorization. Indeed, in recent studies it was shown that a low-rank PMF tensor can be fully recovered (under some mild conditions) by applying a low-rank (approximate) joint factorization to all estimated joint PMFs of subsets of fixed cardinality larger than two (e.g., triplets). The joint factorization is based on a Least Squares (LS) fit to the estimated lower-order sub-tensors. In this letter we take a different estimation approach by fitting the partial factorization directly to the observed partial data in the sense of Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). Consequently, we avoid the need for particular selection and direct estimation of sub-tensors of a particular order, as we inherently apply proper weighting to all the available partial data. We show that our approach essentially attains the Maximum Likelihood estimate of the full PMF tensor (under the low-rank model) and therefore enjoys its well-known properties of consistency and asymptotic efficiency. In addition, based on the Bayesian model interpretation of the low-rank model, we propose an Estimation-Maximization (EM) based approach, which is computationally cheap per iteration. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of our proposed KLD-based hybrid approach (combining alternating-directions minimization with EM) over LS fitting of sub-tensors.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2938663","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8821380","Probability Mass Functions (PMF);Maximum Likelihood (ML);Coupled Tensor Factorization;Kullback-Leibler Divergence;Estimation-Maximization (EM)","Maximum likelihood estimation;Minimization;Computational modeling;Optimization;Radio frequency","","14","","13","IEEE","30 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, current methods suffer from the confusion caused by convolving over time and space independently, processing shorter sequences, restricted to single temporal scale modeling and so on. The key objective of precisely classifying actions is to capture the appearance and motion throughout entire videos. Based on this purpose, a multi-branch spatial-temporal network (MSTN) is proposed. It consists of a multi-branch deep network and a long-term feature (LTF) layer. Benefits of the proposed MSTN include: (a) the multi-branch spatial-temporal network aims at encoding spatial and temporal information simultaneously, and (b) the LTF layer is used to aggregate the video-level representation with multiple temporal scales.
