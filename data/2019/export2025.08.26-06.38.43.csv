The latter roughly located the DOAs and TOAs by relatively small size FFT, followed by the subspace-based technique for a fine-grained searching within a local grid.

However, the performance of a well-trained CNN on an independent dataset (e.g., different vendors, sequences) relies strongly on the distribution similarity, and may drop unexpectedly in case of distribution shift. To obtain a large amount of annotation from each new dataset for re-training the CNN is expensive and impractical. Adaptation algorithms to improve the CNN generalizability from source domain to target domain has significant practical value. In this work, we propose a highly efficient end-to-end domain adaptation approach, with left ventricle segmentation from cine MRI sequences as an example. We propose to perform domain adaptation in the output space where different domains share the strongest similarities. The core of this algorithm is a flexible and light output adaption module based on adversarial learning. Moreover, Canny edge detector is introduced to enhance model's attention to edges during adversarial learning. Comparative experiments were carried out using images from three major MR vendors (Philips, Siemens, and GE) as three domains. Our results demonstrated that the proposed method substantially improved the generalization of the trained CNN model from one vendor to other vendors without any additional annotation. Moreover, the ablation study proved that introducing Canny edge detector further refined the edge detection in segmentation. The proposed adaption is generic can be extended to other medical image segmentation problems.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2940926","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2018YFC0116303); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8832229","Domain adaptation;adversarial learning;semi-supervised learning;edge detection","Image edge detection;Image segmentation;Adaptation models;Training;Biomedical imaging;Task analysis;Magnetic resonance imaging","","34","","29","IEEE","11 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These pseudo ground-truths can be used to train a fully-supervised detector. To estimate the object scale, we firstly adopt a proposal selection algorithm to preserve high-quality proposals, and then generate Class Activation Maps (CAMs) for these preserved proposals by the proposed CNN visualization algorithm called Spatial Attention CAM. Finally, we fuse these CAMs together to generate pseudo ground-truths and train a fully-supervised object detector with these ground-truths.

Specifically, our framework consists of autoencoder and weighted k-subsapce network. We first use the autoencoder to non-linearly compress the samples into the low-dimensional latent space. In the weighted k-subspace network, we feed the latent representation into the assignment network to output soft assignments which represent the probability of data belonging to the according subspace.

While several studies addressed the NILM problem for small-scale buildings, only few studies considered the problem for large buildings, where the signals exhibit significantly different behavior. To overcome the unaddressed difficulties of processing high frequency current signals that are measured in large buildings, we propose a novel technique called Independent-Variation Matrix Factorization (IVMF), which expresses an observation matrix as the product of two matrices: the signature and the activation. Motivated by the nature of the current signals, it uses a regularization term on the temporal variations of the activation matrix and a positivity constraint, and the columns of the signature matrix are constrained to lie in a specific set. To solve the resulting optimization problem, we rely on an alternating minimization strategy involving dual optimization and quasi-Newton algorithms. The algorithm is tested against Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Semi Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SNMF) on a synthetic source separation problem and on a realistic NILM application for large commercial buildings. We show that IVMF outperforms competing methods and is particularly appropriate to recover positive sources that have a strong temporal dependency and sources whose variations are independent from each other.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2941428","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8836542","Dictionary Learning;Semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization;Independent Component Analysis;Total Variation;Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring","Buildings;Optimization;Power demand;Signal processing algorithms;Minimization;Source separation;Monitoring","","10","","18","IEEE","13 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Simulation results show that the approach provides more directions of freedom (DOFs) and/or directional gain compared to the original TS-MIMO and omni-MIMO, which leads to better output SINR results and interference rejection.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2942197","International Graduate Exchange Program; Beijing Institute of Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8844841","Multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO);joint transmit and receive beamforming;sum co-array;optimization","Interference;Signal to noise ratio;Array signal processing;Optimization;MIMO communication;Receivers;Transmitters","","15","","28","IEEE","19 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many times, the true tensor rank is not known, or noise is present, and in such situations, different existing CP decomposition algorithms provide very different results. In this letter, we introduce a notion of sensitivity of CP decomposition and suggest to use it as a side criterion (besides the fitting error) to evaluate different CP decomposition results. Next, we propose a novel variant of a Krylov-Levenberg-Marquardt CP decomposition algorithm which may serve for CP decomposition with a constraint on the sensitivity. In simulations, we decompose order-4 tensors that come from convolutional neural networks. We show that it is useful to combine the CP decomposition algorithms with an error-preserving correction.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2943060","Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation(grant numbers:14.756.31.0001); Czech Science Foundation(grant numbers:17-00902S); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8846103","","Sensitivity;Matrix decomposition;Signal processing algorithms;Convergence;Symmetric matrices;Optimization","","9","","26","IEEE","23 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While much work has focused on estimating mmWave channels and designing beamforming schemes, the time dynamic nature of mmWave channels quickly renders estimates stale and increases sounding overhead. We model the underlying time dynamic state space of mmWave channels with a linear Gauss-Markov process and design sounding beamformers suitable for tracking in an unscented Kalman filtering framework. Given an initial channel estimate, simulation results show that unscented filtering efficiently leads to better estimates than the extended Kalman filter with limited sounding and allows forward prediction for higher sustained beamforming gain during data transmission. Moreover, from tracked prior channel estimates, optimal and constrained suboptimal beams are adaptively chosen for low sounding overhead while minimizing estimation error.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2944255","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:DGE-1333468); NSF(grant numbers:CNS1642982); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8851228","Millimeter wave;beamforming;channel estimation;unscented Kalman filter;tracking","Channel estimation;Receivers;Kalman filters;Transmitters;Array signal processing;Adaptation models;Linear antenna arrays","","57","","37","IEEE","27 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, verbal conflict is an important example of human-interaction behaviour, whose detection would enable monitoring and feedback in a variety of applications. The majority of methods for detection and intensity estimation of verbal conflict apply off-the-shelf classifiers/regressors to generic hand-crafted acoustic features. Generating conflict-specific features requires refinement steps and the availability of metadata, such as the number of speakers and their speech overlap duration. Moreover, most techniques treat feature extraction and regression as independent modules, which require separate training and parameter tuning. To address these limitations, we propose the first end-to-end convolutional-recurrent neural network architecture that learns conflict-specific features directly from raw speech waveforms, without using explicit domain knowledge or metadata. Additionally, to selectively focus the model on portions of speech containing verbal conflict instances, we include a global attention interface that learns the alignment between layers of the recurrent network. Experimental results on the SSPNet Conflict Corpus show that our end-to-end architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of Pearson Correlation Coefficient.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2944004","QMUL Research-IT; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8850055","Computational paralinguistics;conflict intensity estimation;convolutional-recurrent network","Estimation;Feature extraction;Convolution;Task analysis;Metadata;Computer architecture;Support vector machines","","9","","30","IEEE","26 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This fixed step length results in robustness against model errors, e.g., caused by large accelerations or by short-term magnetic field disturbances, which we numerically illustrate using Monte Carlo simulations. Our algorithm estimates a three-dimensional update to the orientation rather than the entire orientation itself. This reduces the computational complexity by approximately 1/3 with respect to the state of the art. It also improves the quality of the resulting estimates, specifically when the orientation corrections are large.

By splitting user messages and linearly precoding common and private streams at the transmitter, and opportunistically asking the relaying user to forward its decoded common message, CRS can efficiently cope with a wide range of propagation conditions (disparity of user channel strengths and directions) and compensate for the performance degradation due to deep fading. The precoder design and the resource allocation are optimized by solving the Weighted Sum Rate (WSR) maximization problem. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed CRS scheme can achieve an explicit rate region improvement compared to its non-cooperative counterpart and other cooperative strategies (such as cooperative NOMA).","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2942994","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/N015312/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8846761","Rate-splitting;resource allocation;relay broadcast channel;rate region;WMMSE algorithm","NOMA;Relays;Resource management;Interference;Silicon carbide;Transmitters;Encoding","","67","","25","IEEE","23 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The transmitter provides two independent services: a public (multicast) service with a common message for both users, and a private service with a confidential message intended only for one of the users which is to be kept secret from the other. Under this scenario, a new linear precoding scheme is developed to maximize secrecy-multicast rate region. This scheme decomposes input covariance matrix using rotation matrices and results in a reformulation of the secrecy-multicast capacity region which is easier to be optimized. Next, by finding the distributions to which eigenvalues and rotation angles fit in, a search algorithm is proposed to solve the new capacity expression to find precoding and power allocation matrices.
