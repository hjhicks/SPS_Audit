They always stack convolutional layers to make network deeper and wider. In addition, most SDSR networks generate HR depth maps at a single level, which is not suitable for large up-sampling factors. To solve these problems, we present pyramid-structured depth map super-resolution based on deep dense-residual network. Specially, our networks are made up of dense residual blocks that use densely connected layers and residual learning to model the mapping between high-frequency residuals and low-resolution (LR) depth map. Furthermore, based on the pyramid structure, our network can progressively generate depth maps of various levels by taking advantages of features from different levels. The proposed network adopts a deep supervision scheme to reduce the difficulty of model training and further improve the performance. The proposed method is evaluated on Middlebury datasets which shows improved performance compared with 6 state-of-the-art methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2944646","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901197); Major Science and Technology Projects in Fujian, China(grant numbers:2018H0018); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi(grant numbers:20192BAB217005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8853318","Depth map super-resolution;residual learning;dense connection;deep convolutional neural networks","Training;Convolution;Interpolation;Feature extraction;Computational modeling","","29","","24","IEEE","30 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, a new sliding algorithm is proposed to solve this problem, termed as the 2D sliding DFrFT (2D SDFrFT). The proposed 2D SDFrFT algorithm directly computes the 2D DFrFT in current window using the results of previous window, which greatly reduces the computations. During the derivation, we find that the (m + δ, n)th DFrFT bin in previous window is needed for computing the (m, n)th DFrFT bin in current window, where the increment δ isn't always an integer. Further, a method is proposed to convert the increment δ to a certain integer by determining appropriate sampling interval.

This 1-bit LMPT detector is based on 1-bit quantized observations without any additional processing at the local sensors. However, direct quantization of observations is not the most efficient processing strategy at the sensors since it incurs unnecessary information loss. In this letter, we propose an improved-1-bit LMPT (Im-1-bit LMPT) detector that fuses local 1-bit quantized likelihood ratios (LRs) instead of directly quantized local observations. In addition, we design the quantization thresholds at the local sensors to ensure asymptotically optimal detection performance of the proposed detector.

Two configurations are presented, a “dispersive delay filter” in which a single dispersive arrival is produced, and a “dispersive comb filter” in which a series of increasingly dispersive echoes of the input signal are generated.

We propose the Secondary Information aware Facial Expression Network (SIFE-Net) to explore the latent components without auxiliary labeling, and we propose a novel dynamic weighting strategy to teach the SIFE-Net. In contrast to traditional classifiers trained with one-hot labels, the proposed SIFE-Net takes advantage of secondary expression information and has more rational feature distributions. We carry out extensive experiments and analysis on three widely-used FER datasets, i.e. the CK+ dataset, the JAFFE dataset, and the RAF dataset.

In this letter, we propose a multi-layer factorized discriminant correlation filter (MLF-DCF) for visual tracking. By integrating the multi-view discriminant learning and the discriminative correlation filter into a unified optimization problem, we can explore the correlation between different target sub-regions from multi-layer viewpoint, thus can effectively prune multi-layer basis filters. To enhance the efficiency of MLF-DCF in terms of speed and accuracy, we not only adopt alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the unified optimization, but also employ a mask estimation strategy to eliminate the background noise in deep features.

In this letter, we consider the recovery of a target signal with the aid of a correlated signal, the so-called side information (SI), and propose a deep unfolding model that incorporates SI. The proposed model is used to learn coupled representations of correlated signals from different modalities, enabling the recovery of multi-modal data at a low computational cost. As such, our work introduces the first deep unfolding method with SI, which actually comes from a different modality.

In the proposed method, a set of trajectory groups are first extracted by utilizing the distance weight of the pairwise points. In order to improve the estimation accuracy, an adaptive rank selection strategy is designed to choose the approximately optimal rank parameter.

A popular approach is to formally replace the proximal operator within the ADMM framework with some powerful denoiser. However, since most state-of-the-art denoisers cannot be posed as a proximal operator, one cannot guarantee the convergence of these so-called plug-and-play (PnP) algorithms. In fact, the theoretical convergence of PnP algorithms is an active research topic. In this letter, we consider the result of Chan et al. (IEEE TCI, 2017), where fixed-point convergence of an ADMM-based PnP algorithm was established for a class of denoisers. We argue that the original proof is incomplete, since convergence is not analyzed for one of the three possible cases outlined in the letter. Moreover, we explain why the argument for the other cases does not apply in this case.

In this letter, a novel Multilevel and Multiscale Network for SISR (M2SR) is presented. The proposed network framework consists of four parts, including the feature extraction network, the cascade residual U-shaped blocks, the channel-wise attention U-shaped block and the fusion reconstruction network. Specially, the residual U-shaped blocks are designed to extract different scales of features, which are stacked to better refine the multifeatures. Then, to fully exploit the different levels of features, a channel-wise attention U-shaped block (At-U) is proposed to adjust the feature weights, which can adaptively enhance the feature expression and correlation learning. Finally, a fusion reconstruction network is constructed to fuse the different scales of the enhanced features to achieve the reconstructed result.

These multilateral foreground/background features are further refined through an encoder-decoder network. As a result, the proposed framework not only detects temporal changes but also learns high-level appearance features. Thus, it incorporates the object semantics for effective change detection. Furthermore, the proposed framework is validated through a scene independent evaluation scheme in order to demonstrate the robustness and generalization capability of the network.

In addition, parameter quantization (PQ) and feature-map quantization (FQ) techniques were also integrated to generate even more compact SE models. The experimental results show that the integration of PP, PQ, and FQ can produce a compacted SE model with a size of only 9.76% compared to that of the original model, resulting in minor performance losses of 0.01 (from 0.85 to 0.84) and 0.03 (from 2.55 to 2.52) for STOI and PESQ scores, respectively.

In this letter, we propose a noise-robust algorithm, Restricted Connection Orthogonal Matching Pursuit for Sparse Subspace Clustering (RCOMP-SSC), to improve the clustering accuracy and remain computationally efficient by restricting the number of connections of each data point during the iteration of OMP. Also, we develop a framework of control matrix to realize RCOMP-SSC. The proposed control matrix can be applied to other selection strategies for data point.

One particular form of interaction that is widely encountered is the modulation of the amplitude of broadband high-frequency oscillations by the phase of low-frequency oscillations, defined as phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). Conventional methods for assessing PAC mostly rely on the Hilbert transform. Previous studies have shown that this method produces biased or spurious PAC estimates as it is highly dependent on the parameters of the bandpass filter used to extract narrowband signals from broadband signals. Recently, wavelet-based methods have been proposed to address some of these limitations. In this letter, we provide a thorough comparison between wavelet-based PAC measures and our recently introduced Reduced Interference Rihaczek (RID-Rihaczek) distribution based PAC both analytically and through simulations.

In this letter, we study the special case of multiple datasets analysis, where all datasets share the same set of underlying sources which contribute to different datasets through different mixing matrices. With the aim of efficient dimension reduction, we propose a novel joint preprocessing method to accurate and robust source separation from multipldatasets. We sequentially separate the source with the most significant impact on all datasets on average. To this end, the magnitudes of source projections on the subspaces spanned by each dataset are obtained and sum of their pth power is maximized.
