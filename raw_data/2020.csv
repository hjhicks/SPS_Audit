In this method, the nonstationarity of corrupted signal segments is used to detect masking distortions based on a defined threshold. The non-stationarity is objectively measured and is also adopted to determine the absorption procedure. Additionally, no prior knowledge of speech statistics or room information is required for this technique. Two intelligibility measures (ESII and ASIIST) are used for objective evaluation. The results show that the proposed scheme leads to a higher intelligibility improvement when compared to competing methods. A perceptual listening test is further considered and corroborates these results. Furthermore, the updated version of the SRMR quality measure (SRMRnorm) demonstrates that the proposed technique also attains quality improvement.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2950618","National Council for Scientific and Technological Development(grant numbers:307866); Fundação de Amparo Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro(grant numbers:203075); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior(grant numbers:001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8888254","Reverberation;absorption;non-stationarity;intelligibility","Absorption;Reverberation;Noise measurement;Distortion measurement;Acoustic distortion;Acoustic measurements","","2","","23","IEEE","31 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first investigate the energy distribution of the Auto-Terms (ATs) and CTs in ambiguity plane. This reveals that the energy of the CTs of parallel close components is significant around the origin. We propose to mask the samples in which the CTs may have interferences with the ATs. This mask is signal-dependent and its directions are determined using the relationship between the radial slices of ambiguity function (AF) and the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT). Exploiting sparsity in time-frequency (TF) domain and by solving an ℓ1-norm minimization problem, the localized time-frequency distribution (TFD) is extracted from the acquired samples of the AF.

The main reason is that the conventional mean squared error (MSE) loss cannot represent auditory perception well. One of the typical human-perception-related metrics, which is the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), has been proven to provide a high correlation to the quality scores rated by humans. Owing to its complex and non-differentiable properties, however, the PESQ function may not be used to optimize speech enhancement models directly. In this study, we propose optimizing the enhancement model with an approximated PESQ function, which is differentiable and learned from the training data. The experimental results show that the learned surrogate function can guide the enhancement model to further boost the PESQ score (increase of 0.18 points compared to the results trained with MSE loss) and maintain the speech intelligibility.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2953810","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8902088","Perception optimization;PESQ;speech enhancement;speech quality assessment","Speech enhancement;Training;Spectrogram;Linear programming;Data models;Training data;Signal to noise ratio","","51","","36","IEEE","15 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This discrete nature makes trouble for methods which need gradients either from the input space or from the output space. Recently, a new learning method called joint stochastic approximation is developed for unsupervised learning of fixed-dimensional autoencoders and theoretically avoids gradient propagation through discrete latent variables, which is suffered by Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). In this letter, we propose seq2seq Joint-stochastic-approximation AutoEncoders (JAEs) and apply them to S4 learning for NLP sequence transduction tasks. Further, we propose bi-directional JAEs (called bi-JAEs) to leverage not only unpaired input sequences (which is most commonly studied) but also unpaired output sequences. Experiments on two benchmarking datasets for semantic parsing show that JAEs consistently outperform VAEs in S4 learning and bi-JAEs yield further improvements.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2953999","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976122); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8903435","Semi-supervised learning;seq2seq;semantic parsing;joint stochastic approximation;variational auto-encoder","Semantics;Task analysis;Decoding;Natural language processing;Training;Semisupervised learning","","6","","19","IEEE","18 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To be more specific, the quadratic and sparseness-inducing norms are combined to construct regularization term, and the objective function is gradually minimized without requirement of regularization parameter choice. In particular, we propose an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method equipped with closed-form solution, artifacts processing and non-negative constraint to approximate the posterior distribution and estimate uncertainty for the unknown. Satisfactory deblurring results with sharp edges can be generated while maintaining smoothness without raising extra noise.

At the end of the algorithm, the set of all particles and weights can be used to perform estimation. The resampling step is an adaptive mechanism of the PMC algorithm that allows for particles to locate the most significant regions of the sampling space. In this letter, we generalize the adaptation procedure of PMC sampling by providing a perspective based on stochastic optimization rather than resampling.

The multipath arrivals are mainly concerned with the direct (D) and surface-reflected (SR) paths. Three types of multipath time-delays are obtained, namely, the average D-D time-delay and SR-SR time-delay between two adjacent hydrophones, and the D-SR time-delay at the first hydrophone. The proposed method has significant advantages for underwater applications. First, the D and SR arrivals are successfully separated from time-delay estimation point of view, outperforming the estimation of direction of arrival with conventional beamforming. Second, the estimations of the average D-D time-delay and SR-SR time-delay between two adjacent hydrophones occur at the diagonal line of the two-dimensional DAS outputs, facilitating the automatic detection and extraction of multipath time-delays. Third, the estimation is robust against noisy background noise due to the spatial accumulative effect. The method is applied to experimental data for explosive source at ~17 km range and 300 m depth, where it is shown that simple, stable, and fairly accurate multipath time-delay estimation can be made.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2954979","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901383); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2019JQ633); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8908704","Cross-correlation function;delay-and-sum;multipath time-delay","Sonar equipment;Estimation;Signal processing algorithms;Correlation;Noise measurement;Acoustics;Delays","","17","","24","IEEE","21 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While the multiplicative processor requires fewer sensors to achieve the same resolution as a conventional linear processor, it also produces cross terms that can degrade the spectral estimate. Cross terms are false peaks formed when a signal passing through the grating lobe of one subarray interacts with a different signal passing through the other subarray. Snapshot averaging reduces cross terms when the signals are uncorrelated. This letter quantifies the number of snapshots required for effective cross term mitigation, accounting for the use of subarray tapers to control sidelobe levels. To facilitate the analysis, the letter derives closed form expressions for the probability density function and cumulative distribution function of the sum of products of independent complex Gaussian random variables. The analysis demonstrates that cross terms decay at a rate of 5 dB per decade of snapshots averaged. While subarray tapering reduces sidelobe leakage, it also increases the number of snapshots required for cross term mitigation.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2955815","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-17-1-2734,N00014-18-1-2669); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8911484","Multiplicative processors;sparse arrays;spatial spectrum estimation;distribution of sum of products of independent complex Gaussian random variables","Program processors;Gratings;Probability density function;Random variables;Sensor arrays;Geometry","","3","","49","IEEE","25 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Typically, the mask is estimated with a deep neural network (DNN), and element-wise applied to the complex mixture short-time Fourier transform (STFT) representation to perform the extraction. Ideal mask magnitudes are zero for solely undesired signals in a TF bin and undefined for total destructive interference. Usually, masks have an upper bound to provide well-defined DNN outputs at the cost of limited extraction capabilities. We propose to estimate with a DNN a complex TF filter for each mixture TF bin which maps an STFT area in the respective mixture to the desired TF bin to address destructive interference in mixture TF bins. The DNN is optimized by minimizing the error between the extracted and the ground-truth desired signal allowing to learn the TF filters without having to specify ground-truth TF filters. We compare our approach with complex and real-valued TF masks by separating speech from a variety of different sound and noise classes from the Google AudioSet corpus. We also process the mixture STFT with notch-filters and zero whole time-frames, to simulate packet-loss during transmission, to demonstrate the reconstruction capabilities of our approach.

We propose a cover selection method to combine the two kinds of distortion together to measure the suitability for steganography of the available images. To calculate the processing distortion, a classifier is trained to distinguish the processed images with the original ones. The classifier is then used to measure the possibility of the existence of processing. High possibility means high processing distortion. In addition, the current distortion minimization framework designed for steganography is employed to calculate the embedding distortion.

NMF requires that each data point is approximated by a convex combination of basis elements. Archetypal analysis (AA), also referred to as convex NMF, is a well-known NMF variant imposing that the basis elements are themselves convex combinations of the data points. AA has the advantage to be more interpretable than NMF because the basis elements are directly constructed from the data points. However, it usually suffers from a high data fitting error because the basis elements are constrained to be contained in the convex cone of the data points. In this letter, we introduce near-convex archetypal analysis (NCAA) which combines the advantages of both AA and NMF.

Our approach requires the user to mark one pixel in each texture region, whose label is directly propagated to its neighbor region. Such labeled data are of very small amount and even partially erroneous. To effectively exploit such weakly-labeled data, we construct a weakly-supervised sparse coding model that jointly conducts feature learning and segmentation.

However, lossy compression is not commonly used in medical imaging as the process may irreversibly remove information that defines clinically important image features. The lossy component of JPEG compression is represented as lost precision in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain after quantization on $8 \times 8$ image blocks and results in degradation of the image. We propose a cross-domain cascade of U-nets called the W-net. This network operates in the DCT domain to restore discarded DCT coefficients that leverages information from adjacent blocks, and the image domain to suppress compression artifacts at the image pixel level. For comparison, we adapted the Automated Transform by Manifold Approximation (AUTOMAP) method for JPEG decompression by learning the dequantization of individual $8 \times 8$ DCT coefficient blocks. These results were then transformed to the image domain and processed by a U-net. The deep learning models were able to suppress common compression artifacts at the expense of high spatial frequency detail. Both the W-net and AUTOMAP network structures were quantitatively superior to standard JPEG decompression, with the W-net outperforming AUTOMAP, suggesting that leveraging DCT coefficients from adjacent blocks improves JPEG decompression performance.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2961072","Natural Science and Engineering Research Council; AWS Cloud Credits for Research program; NSERC CREATE I3T Award; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8937815","Convolutional neural network (CNN);image reconstruction;JPEG decompression;teleradiography","Discrete cosine transforms;Transform coding;Image coding;Image restoration;Biological neural networks;Quantization (signal);Training","","12","","22","IEEE","20 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, we propose a new approach for quickly constructing high-quality adversarial images. Compared with original images, the generative adversarial images are more suitable for carrying secret information.

Specifically, we first partition the colors of a 3D point cloud into clusters by applying k-d tree to the geometry information, which are then successively encoded. To eliminate the redundancy, we propose a novel prediction module, namely graph prediction, in which a small number of representative points selected from previously encoded clusters are used to predict the points to be encoded by exploring the underlying graph structure constructed from the geometry information. Furthermore, the prediction residuals are transformed with the graph transform, and the resulting transform coefficients are finally uniformly quantified and entropy encoded.

In neuroscience, how an incentive affects an observer is measured by the surprise of this incentive which is estimated by the residual self-information according to the effective coding theory. Considering the competition biases, we define the product of the residual self-information and the biases, named as perceptual surprise, to measure the positive effect. As for the negative effect, we measure it with the average surprise (i.e., local Shannon entropy). Besides, visual signals are processed hierarchically in the HVS. To simplify the JND modeling process, the HVS is divided into two levels and the perception is simply divided into two stages. In each stage, the threshold is estimated individually and the total JND threshold is obtained by non-linear superposition of two stage thresholds. Experimental results show that the proposed JND model outperforms the existing pixel-based JND models and effectively avoid the threshold overestimation issue.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2957647","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871437,61572449); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province of China(grant numbers:2019CFA022); National Key Research and Development Project(grant numbers:2018YFC0830106); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8922725","JND estimation;perceptual surprise;masking","Visualization;Estimation;Entropy;Neurons;Visual perception;Neuroscience;Brain modeling","","20","","31","IEEE","4 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The resulting new latent space is found to be much more suitable for clustering, since clustering information is used. Inspired by previous works (Song et al. 2013), in this letter we propose several extensions to this technique. First, we propose a probabilistic approach to generalize Song's approach, such that Euclidean distance in the latent space is now represented by KL divergence.

In this paper, we consider a massive MIMO uplink with ternary/three level ADCs. The design of typical linear combiner based detectors is given along with their analytical symbol-error-rate (SER) performance results. Analytical and simulation results show that 1) ternary ADCs can effectively compensate the SER performance gap between 1-bit and full-resolution ADCs; 2) optimal design of ternary ADCs for SER minimization can be referred to the existing design for quantization error minimization; 3) ternary ADCs perform better than 2-bit ADCs in energy efficiency.

The bit depth used to quantize the sensor signal samples heavily influences energy consumption, as it strongly impacts the amount of information to be transmitted between the sensor nodes. Bit depth allocation problems seek to assign a certain bit depth to each sensor signal such that energy consumption is minimized while respecting a performance constraint. For multi-channel signal estimation tasks these problems are generally non-convex, and they are often solved through simplifying assumptions or through convex relaxation. However, for linear minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation, we show how the matrix inversion lemma allows to transform the MMSE constraint into a convex constraint, which can then be interpreted as a constraint on the excess MMSE due to quantization. As a result, as long as the cost function representing energy consumption is convex, this class of bit depth allocation problems is convex, i.e., if the bit depth variable is relaxed to a real-valued variable. This guarantees global optimality up to discretization of the obtained solution.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.2967592","ESAT Laboratory of KU Leuven; Research Fund KU Leuven(grant numbers:C14/16/057,FWO nr.

However, this algorithm suffers from two drawbacks, which we address in this letter. First, it has originally been introduced in a heuristic fashion: we propose here a rigorous optimization framework in which MISI is derived, thus proving the convergence of this algorithm. Besides, while MISI operates offline, we propose here an online version of MISI called oMISI, which is suitable for low-latency source separation, an important requirement for e.g., hearing aids applications. oMISI also allows one to use alternative phase initialization schemes exploiting the temporal structure of audio signals.

While this can be addressed by training multiple models for different tradeoffs, the memory requirements increase proportionally to the number of models. Scaling the bottleneck representation of a shared autoencoder can provide variable rate compression with a single shared autoencoder. However, the R-D performance using this simple mechanism degrades in low bitrates, and also shrinks the effective range of bitrates. To address these limitations, we formulate the problem of variable R-D optimization for DIC, and propose modulated autoencoders (MAEs), where the representations of a shared autoencoder are adapted to the specific R-D tradeoff via a modulation network. Jointly training this modulated autoencoder and the modulation network provides an effective way to navigate the R-D operational curve.

However, the online learning of CFs is problematic because of the increasing number of training samples as the tracking process goes on. To solve this issue, most CFs-based methods decouple the learning phase and updating phase of the correlation filters and then use a simple linear interpolation to fuse the newly learned correlation filters with the old ones for fast computing. Nevertheless, the linear interpolation may be an unwise way to update the model. In this letter, we propose a smooth incremental learning framework of CFs. In our method, the increments of the correlation filters are smoothly learned by minimizing an optimization problem in each frame, thus avoiding the ad hoc linear interpolation. The optimization problem can be efficiently solved via the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Furthermore, a rotation estimation strategy is introduced to enable the correlation filters to accurately estimate the rotation angle of the target.

For this problem, an original locally most powerful test (oLMPT) detector has previously been developed, where compressed measurements are collected from all local sensors and then fused at the fusion center (FC) for making the global decision. However, since the sensors always operate on limited energy resources, allowing all the nodes to send their observations to the FC all the time exerts tremendous pressure on their energy consumption and hinders the longevity of the sensors. To solve this problem, we propose a new censoring LMPT (cen-LMPT) detector by combining the strengths of censoring strategy and the oLMPT detector, where sensors are designated to merely send observations deemed informative enough so as to utilize the local energy more efficiently, and the FC still makes the global decision based on LMPT. We analytically derive the relationship between the detection performance and the communication rate for the proposed detector. It is shown that, compared with the oLMPT detector, the proposed cen-LMPT detector with the same number of nodes can achieve almost the same detection performance with significantly lower communication rate and, therefore, much lower local energy consumption. The simulation results verify our theoretical findings.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.2970580","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61790551,61925106); Civil Space Advance Research Program of China(grant numbers:D010305); National Science Foundation of USA(grant numbers:ENG 60064237); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8976280","Censoring sensors;distributed detection;energy constraints;locally most powerful tests;sparse signals","Detectors;Sensor fusion;Testing;Probability density function;Energy resources;Energy consumption","","8","","24","IEEE","30 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, to tackle the multi-view clustering problem, we propose a novel approach to fuse multiple affinity graphs computed in each single view to a unified affinity graph, so that single-view affinity-based clustering methods can be accordingly applied on it. The edges in the unified affinity graph between a node and its neighbors are computed as weighted average over the corresponding edges from multiple single graphs, and the weights here are adaptive to each node, estimated using the Extreme Value Theory (EVT).

The key feature of the proposed algorithm is the so-called Onsager correction via a convolution of messages in all preceding iterations while the conventional message-passing algorithms have correction terms that depend only on messages in the latest iteration. Thus, the proposed algorithm is called convolutional AMP (CAMP). Ill-conditioned sensing matrices are simulated as an example in which the convergence of AMP is not guaranteed.

The Triamese network uses a contrastive loss to reduce the distance between frames of the same predicted word type while increasing the distance between negative examples. For the first time, these feature extractors are compared on the same discrimination tasks using the same weak supervision pairs. We find that, on the two datasets considered here, the CAE outperforms the Triamese network. However, we show that a new hybrid correspondence-Triamese approach (CTriamese), consistently outperforms both the CAE and Triamese models in terms of average precision and ABX error rates on both English and Xitsonga evaluation data.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.2973798","National Research Foundation of South Africa(grant numbers:120409); Google Faculty Award; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8998226","Unsupervised learning;correspondence autoencoders;Siamese networks;zero-resource speech processing","Acoustics;Training;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Speech processing;Standards;Data models","","11","","40","IEEE","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, a game-theoretical bilevel optimization problem is formulated to model the decision-making interaction between the upper-level attacker and the lower-level security constrained economic dispatching system.

Concretely, the logit distillation regards the output of teacher model as soft target to stimulate the student model. The feature distillation distills the high-level features of the teacher model to assist the student. Unlike the above strategies, the structure distillation considers the problem in a global view, aiming at ensuring the student prediction contains quite abundant structure knowledge like the teacher.

In this study, we propose a new extrapolation-based video retargeting method using an image-to-warping vector generation network to maintain temporal coherence and prevent deformation of an input frame by extending the side area of an input frame. Backward warping-based extrapolation is performed using a displacement vector (DV) that is generated by a proposed convolutional neural network (CNN). The DV is defined as the displacement between the current hole to be filled in the extended area and a pixel in the input frame used to fill the hole. We also propose a technique to efficiently train the CNN including a method for ground-truth DV generation. After the extrapolation, we propose a technique for the maintenance of temporal coherence of the extended region and a distortion suppression scheme (DSC) for minimizing visual artifacts.

As labeling abundant examples for all kinds of classes in realistic scenarios is costly and impractical, GZSL has become a novel and hot field of research in recent years. Most previous methods tried to learn a fixed one-directional mapping, either from visual to semantic features, or from semantic to visual features. However, recently, cross mapping between visual and semantic features has achieved good results and many methods come up based on this idea. In this paper, we propose a novel model. It is Multi-channel Gaussian Mixture VAE(MCGM-VAE), which introduces Gaussian mixture model to our multi-modal VAE with multiple channels. These channels are of different weight coefficients following with channel-weight layers, so as to produce a Gaussian mixture distribution. Then the latent space could be generated from it. We evaluate our method on several benchmark databases, i.e. CUB, SUN, AWA1, AWA2, aPY and prove our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

However, since photographers, designers, and high-end users prefer to work with the raw image sampled by CFA (referred to as “raw image”) directly, a raw image should be compressed before demosaicing. For effective raw image compression, this study introduces variable macropixel spectral-spatial transforms (VMSSTs), that can successfully decorrelate not only Bayer raw images but any other pure-color (RGB) ones. The proposed VMSSTs are designed by the following two steps: 1) intra-color decorrelation and 2) inter-color decorrelation. In lossless compression with JPEG 2000, compared with methods which do not use transforms, the VMSSTs reduced the average bitrates of three types of CFAs: from approximately 0.09 to 0.12 bpp for the modified Bayer CFA, from 0.25 to 0.65 bpp for the diagonal stripe CFA, and from 0.33 to 0.70 bpp for the Fujifilm X-Trans CFA due to their high color decorrelation efficiency. In addition, in lossy compression with JPEG 2000, compared with a rearranged method, the VMSSTs improved the average bitrates of the Bjøntegaard delta by around 3.97%, 14.95%, and 18.65% for each CFA model, respectively. Although a data-dependent adaptive transformation, the Karhunen-Loève transform (KLT), showed the best performance in lossy compression, the introduced VMSSTs have shown performances comparable to those of the KLT in lossless compression, despite their simple structures.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.2977500","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9019880","Color filter array;color transform;macropixel;pure-color;raw image;spectral-spatial transform","Image color analysis;Decorrelation;Image coding;Transform coding;Bit rate;Wavelet transforms","","","","23","IEEE","2 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on this new formulation, a new algorithm leveraging hybrid generalized approximate passing (HyGAMP) is then developed including GAMP part (channel estimation) and loopy belief propagation (LBP) part (user activity detection), where the strong correlation among elements in each row of the channel matrix can be decoupled in LBP part. By exchanging the information between the GAMP part and the LBP part, the proposed algorithm improves the performance of channel estimation and user activity detection as compared to earlier results.

However, the quantization operation impedes the flow of gradient and often disturbs the optimal learning of the encoder, which results in distortion in the reconstructed images. To alleviate this problem, this paper presents a simple yet effective way that enhances the performance of lossy image compression without imposing training overhead or modifying the original network architectures. In the proposed method, we utilize an auxiliary branch called a shortcut which directly connects the encoder and decoder. Since the shortcut does not include the quantization process, it supports the optimal learning of the encoder by flowing the accurate gradient. Furthermore, to assist the decoder which should handle additional feature maps obtained via the shortcut, we also propose a residual refinement unit (RRU) following the quantizer. The experimental results show that the image compression network trained with the proposed method remarkably improves the performance in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM), and multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM).","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.2982561","Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion; Korea government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2017-0-00250); Intelligent Defense Boundary Surveillance Technology Using Collaborative Reinforced Learning of Embedded Edge Camera and Image Analysis; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9044407","Convolutional neural network;deep learning;image compression","Image coding;Training;Decoding;Quantization (signal);Image reconstruction;Learning systems;Convolution","","10","","22","IEEE","23 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The variance of the error of an adversary's estimate of the parameters of the quadratic cost function based on iterates of the algorithm is related to the Fisher information of the noise using the Cramér-Rao bound. This motivates using the Fisher information as a measure of privacy. Noting that the performance degradation in noisy gradient descent is proportional to the variance of the noise, a measure of utility is defined to be equal to the variance of the noise. Trade-off between privacy and utility is balanced by minimizing the Fisher information subject to a constraint on the variance of the noise. The optimal privacy-preserving noise is proved to be Gaussian, which implies that the developed privacy-preserving optimization algorithm also guarantees differential privacy.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.2983320","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9050899","Optimization algorithm;constrained optimization;quadratic cost;noisy gradient descent;Fisher information;privacy-preserving optimization","Privacy;Noise measurement;Signal processing algorithms;Differential privacy;Cost function","","6","","41","Crown","30 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although BMP can outperform the other existing methods as Quantized Compressive Sampling Matched Pursuit (QCoSaMP) and Quantized Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (QISTA), its accuracy is still far from the optimal, yielding a locally optimal solution. Motivated by this, we propose an advanced greedy algorithm by leveraging the idea of a stack algorithm, which is referred to as stacked BMP (StBMP). The key idea of the proposed algorithm is to store a number of candidate partial paths (i.e., the candidate support sets) in an ordered stack and tries to find the global optimal solution by searching along the best path in the stack. The proposed method can efficiently remove unnecessary paths having lower path metrics, which can provide a lower complexity.

As a result of the ill-posedness of the problem, recovery is impossible for arbitrary signal and corruption.

In practice, penalized programs exhibit a sharp phase transition, and this letter presents a partial analysis for this phenomenon, which focuses on the problem when they fail. In the analysis, we present a geometry condition determining the failure of penalized programs. Then, if the sensing matrix has independent normal entries, the geometry condition can be studied using Gaussian process theory, and we obtain the threshold for the measurement number below which penalized problems fail with high probability. Moreover, to compute the obtained threshold in practice, we present a computable upper bound for it.

Localization predictions for every pair of 90 subjects in the HUTUBS database are first computed through an interaural time difference-based auditory model, and an error metric based on the predicted lateral error is derived. A multiple stepwise linear regression model for predicting error from inter-subject anthropometric differences is then built on a subset of subjects and evaluated on a complementary test set. Results show that by using just three anthropometric parameters of the head and torso (head width, head depth, and shoulder circumference) the model is able to identify non-individual HRTFs whose predicted horizontal localization error generally lies below the localization blur. When using a lower number of anthropometric parameters, this result is not guaranteed.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.2983633","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(grant numbers:797850); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9050904","Anthropometry;auditory model;HRTF;ITD;sound localization","Predictive models;Azimuth;Databases;Computational modeling;Acoustic measurements;Market research","","11","","28","CCBY","30 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Algorithmically, this involves repeated inversion (of the forward model) and denoising until convergence. Remarkably, PnP regularization produces promising results for several restoration applications. However, a fundamental question in this regard is the theoretical convergence of the PnP iterations, since the algorithm is not strictly derived from an optimization framework. This question has been investigated in recent works, but there are still many unresolved problems. For example, it is not known if convergence can be guaranteed if we use generic kernel denoisers (e.g. nonlocal means) within the ISTA framework (PnP-ISTA). We prove that, under reasonable assumptions, fixed-point convergence of PnP-ISTA is indeed guaranteed for linear inverse problems such as deblurring, inpainting and superresolution (the assumptions are verifiable for inpainting).

In this paper we propose a multi-task model architecture that consists of a shared encoder and multiple task-specific adapters. During training, we learn the model parameters as well as the allocation of the task-specific additional resources across both tasks and layers. A global tuning parameter can be used to obtain different multi-task network configurations finding the desired trade-off between cost and the level of accuracy across tasks. Our results show that this solution significantly outperforms a multi-head model baseline.

However, conventional low-rank matrix factorization-based methods often require a prespecified rank, which is challenging to determine in practice. The proposed method factorizes an image matrix as a sum of rank-one matrices so that it does not require rank information in advance as it can be automatically estimated by the algorithm itself when the algorithm has satisfactorily converged. In our study, matching pursuit is applied to search for the best rank-one matrix at each iteration. To be robust against impulsive noise, the residual error between the observed and estimated matrices is minimized by ℓp-norm with 0 <; p <; 2. Then the resultant ℓp-norm minimization is solved by the iteratively reweighted least squares method. The proposed model is beneficial for the robustness against outliers, and does not require rank information. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and higher accuracy of the proposed method with comparison to several state-of-the-art matrix completion-based image inpainting approaches.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.2988596","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9072537","Image inpainting;low-rank matrix completion;outlier-robustness; $\ell _p$ -minimization;matching pursuit","Matrix converters;Robustness;Minimization;Matrix decomposition;Matching pursuit algorithms;Convergence;Signal processing algorithms","","30","","30","IEEE","20 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For example, matching a texture-rich patch to an old-man face overconfidently. We formulate this challenge on the task of out-of-distribution detection (OOD), where a network must determine whether or not an input is outside of the set on which the network can safely perform. In this paper, we propose to detect out-of-distribution samples based on uncertainty prediction and the L2-norm of features, so as to effectively filter out non-face and low-quality faces.

When supervised by softmax loss (SL), which is widely used in FER, the classifier is often biased against minority categories (i.e., smaller interclass angular distances). In this letter, we present advanced softmax loss (ASL) to mitigate the bias induced by data imbalance and hence increase accuracy and reliability. The proposed ASL essentially magnifies the interclass diversity in the angular space to enhance discriminative power in every category. The proposed loss can easily be implemented in any deep network.

Methods based on Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) have been used as an effective solution to reduce such discrepancy, while the ones leveraged by deep learning (D-UDA) have improved the classification results over shallow approaches. However, most D-UDA methods assume that even though there are differences in marginal distributions between source and target domains, their conditional distributions remain fixed, which does not hold in many EEG databases. To address this problem, we propose a new D-UDA method, named Custom Domain Adaptation (CDA), which integrates Adaptive Batch Normalization (AdaBN) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) into two independent deep neural networks in order to reduce the marginal and conditional distribution differences. CDA was compared with six popular D-UDA methods using a free-available dataset of cognitive loads and obtained an accuracy of $98.2\pm 2.67\%$, which outperformed these state-of-the-art methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.2989663","National Council of Science and Technology in Mexico(grant numbers:#554740); Magdiel Jiménez-Guarneros; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9076296","Unsupervised domain adaptation;EEG-based classification;cognitive load;deep learning","Training;Electroencephalography;Neural networks;Deep learning;Task analysis;Testing;Computer vision","","47","","40","IEEE","22 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Equiripple filters are optimal in terms of a minimal filter length for an arbitrary filter specification. The novel design is based on an equiripple approximating polynomial which approximates two constants in two disjoint intervals in optimal equiripple sense. A recursive formula for evaluating the impulse response of the filter is also introduced.

Considering Kerckhoffs' principle and the watermarked-only attack (WOA) scenario, we derive the associated decoding regions under brute force attack in which the adversary randomly draws probing keys until getting access to the watermarking channel. We first reveal that the sub-ISS system is as equally secure as the conventional ISS system in terms of message decoding, but the sensed key could provide computational security of the spreading key. More importantly, the RMP-ISS system is shown to be securer than the conventional ISS system for it being able to survive brute force attack. Based on the findings, we further propose an empirical design mechanism that optimizes the security of the RMP-ISS scheme.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.2986154","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802284); Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:2018CFB225); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9066930","Watermarking security;spread spectrum security;over-complete dictionary;compressive sensing security","Decoding;Watermarking;Transforms;Force;Matching pursuit algorithms;Dictionaries","","9","","13","IEEE","14 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The first two sub-networks are used for extracting saliency from RGB image and RGB-D image pair, respectively. The third sub-network refines the saliency map by comprehensively considering RGB image, depth map and the refined saliency map of the first two sub-networks.

First, we prove that the proposed method can increase the degrees of freedom (DOF) of an arbitrary moving sparse array threefold. Therefore, the maximal number of resolvable sources for direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation is tripled as well. Furthermore, we prove that the difference coarray of synthetic arrays is a hole-free uniform linear array (ULA) if the difference coarray of original arrays is hole-free. Therefore, for ULA based DOA estimation methods, better performance can be achieved by fully employing all elements in the difference coarray of synthetic arrays. In addition, unlike the dilated nested array method, which enlarges the intersensor spacing of nested arrays threefold to triple DOF, the proposed method does not need to increase array aperture physically. Thus it is more practical to mount a sensor array on a moving platform when taking space limitation into consideration. Simulation results are given to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.2993956","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(grant numbers:RGPIN239031); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9091219","Sparse arrays;degrees of freedom (DOF);virtual arrays;moving arrays;direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation","Array signal processing;Apertures;Sensor arrays;Direction-of-arrival estimation;Estimation;Covariance matrices;Narrowband","","33","","38","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, the resulting higher order tensor is completed using low rank Tensor Train decomposition. Comparing to previous Hankelization approaches, in the proposed approach, blocks of elements are used for Hankelization instead of individual elements, which results in producing a higher order tensor.

Fraud detection systems decide if a credit card transactions should be verified more closely. Many of these decision making systems use machine learning methods that fit complex models to massive datasets. The successful deployment of machine learning (ML) methods to many (critical) application domains crucially depends on its explainability. Indeed, humans have a strong desire to get explanations that resolve the uncertainty about experienced phenomena like the predictions and decisions obtained from ML methods. Explainable ML is challenging since explanations must be tailored (personalized) to individual users with varying backgrounds. Some users might have received university-level education in ML, while other users might have no formal training in linear algebra. Linear regression with few features might be perfectly interpretable for the first group but might be considered a black-box by the latter. We propose a simple probabilistic model for the predictions and user knowledge. This model allows to study explainable ML using information theory.

In this paper, we propose a deep spectral-spatial network (DSSN) for resolving the problem of single image deblurring. Specifically, the proposed method is able to efficiently recover scene characteristics in a global manner by minimizing differences of the frequency magnitude between the blurred input and corresponding sharp image via the spectral restorer, and the spatial restorer fine-tunes local details of the intermediate result, which is estimated by the spectral one, based on the intensity similarity. This cascaded scheme of deblurring processes is fairly desirable for clearly restoring edge-like structures as well as the textural information in a coarse-to-fine manner.

Concretely, the data matrix of each modality is modeled as a superposition of two terms: 1) a low-rank matrix capturing the background information and 2) a kernelized sparse matrix capturing the non-linear correlated components among the audio and visual modalities and, hence, revealing the active speaker.

Recently, deep learning models have been adopted in modulation recognition, which outperform traditional machine learning techniques based on hand-crafted features. However, automatic modulation classification is still challenging due to the following reasons. Existing deep learning methods are only applicable to the data of the same distribution. In practical scenarios, data distribution is varying with sampling frequency, thus domains with different sampling rates are formed. Besides, it is difficult to construct large-scale well-annotated datasets for all domains of interest. We define the domain with sufficient data as the source domain, while the domain with insufficient data as the target domain. Obviously, the classification model performs weakly in the target domain. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarial transfer learning architecture (ATLA), incorporating adversarial training and knowledge transfer in a unified way. Adversarial training performs an asymmetric mapping between domains and reduces the domain shift. Knowledge transfer is used to mine prior knowledge from the source domain. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ATLA substantially boosts the performance of the target model, which outperforms the existing parameter-transfer approach. With half of the training data reduced, the target model achieves competitive recognition accuracy to supervised learning. With one-tenth of training data, the promoted accuracy is up to 17.3% points.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.2991875","BUPT Basic Research Fund(grant numbers:500419757); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901049); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9084381","Adversarial transfer learning;domain adaptation;modulation recognition;sampling frequency","Modulation;Deep learning;Data models;Training;Training data;Supervised learning;Signal to noise ratio","","123","","16","IEEE","1 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, we propose an end-to-end 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for ASC, named SeNoT-Net, which can generate effective audio representations by capturing temporal relations from semantic neighbors of different receptive fields over time. The SeNoT-Net treats the Log-Mel spectrogram as an ordered segment-level sequence. For each segment, the residual block can produce the semantic feature maps, then the semantic neighbors over time (SeNoT) module is applied to capture the relations between each feature point in the feature maps and its top-k semantic neighbors.

Most existing recovery algorithms require the prior knowledge of the sparsity or the noise power, which are unknown or even time-varying in actual applications, to determine the termination condition of the iterative recovery process. Motivated by the entropy concept from information theory, a frequency-domain entropy (FDE)-based blind support recovery algorithm is proposed, where the FDE is employed as the test statistic to determine whether there is a sparse signal remains in the residual signal. Specifically, the statistical distribution of the residual signal is proved to be Gaussian when the recovery iterations are adequately satisfied. Then, the cumulative distribution function of the test statistic and the closed-form expressions of the stop threshold are derived. Our proposed algorithm exploits the merit that the FDE is uncorrelated with the noise power, thus the estimation of the noise power is not required.

Most recent covariance matrix estimators use either shrinkage transformations or asymptotic results from Random Matrix Theory (RMT). Both of these techniques try to achieve a similar goal which is to remove noisy correlations and add structure to SCM to overcome the bias-variance trade-off. Both methods have their respective pros and cons. In this paper, we propose an improved estimator which exploits the advantages of these techniques by taking optimally weighted convex combination of covariance matrices estimated by shrinkage transformation and a filter based on RMT. It is a generalized estimator which can adapt to changing sampling noise conditions by performing hyperparameter optimization. Using data from six of the world's biggest stock exchanges, we show that the proposed estimator outperforms the existing estimators in minimizing the out-of-sample risk of the portfolio and hence predicts population statistics more precisely.

Automated methods in literature classify the individual B-scans and aggregate the diagnosis decision for the OCT volume using manual threshold-based rules. However, these methods lack generalizability and fail to incorporate the ophthalmologists’ aspects of clinical diagnosis. Therefore, in this letter, we propose a B-scan attentive convolutional neural network (BACNN) that mimics the ophthalmologists’ way of diagnosis by focusing on the clinically informative B- scans during the classification process. Specifically, a CNN based feature extraction module is used to extract spatial feature representations from the B-scans. Then, a self-attention module aggregates these features based on their clinical relevance to obtain a discriminative high-level feature vector for a reliable diagnosis.

The product of the number of nonzero samples in the time domain and the frequency domain is greater or equal to the total number of signal samples. The support uncertainty principle has been extended to the arbitrary orthogonal pairs of signal basis and the graph signals, stating that the product of supports in the vertex domain and the spectral domain is greater than the reciprocal squared maximum absolute value of the basis functions. This form is then used in compressive sensing and sparse signal processing to define the reconstruction conditions. In this letter, we will revisit the graph signal uncertainty principle using the graph Rihaczek distribution as an analysis tool and derive an improved bound for the support uncertainty principle of graph signals.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.3000686","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9110738","Uncertainty principle;Graph signals;Spectral analysis;Vertex-frequency analysis;Time-frequency analysis","Uncertainty;Discrete Fourier transforms;Signal processing;Laplace equations;Compressed sensing;Time-frequency analysis","","5","","15","IEEE","8 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, video clips usually contain large amounts of data and pose a high cost in terms of computational resources and thus may complicate the SE system. As an alternative source, a bone-conducted speech signal has a moderate data size while manifesting speech-phoneme structures, and thus complements its air-conducted counterpart. In this study, we propose a novel multi-modal SE structure in the time domain that leverages bone- and air-conducted signals. In addition, we examine two ensemble-learning-based strategies, early fusion (EF) and late fusion (LF), to integrate the two types of speech signals, and adopt a deep learning-based fully convolutional network to conduct the enhancement. The experiment results on the Mandarin corpus indicate that this newly presented multi-modal (integrating bone- and air-conducted signals) SE structure significantly outperforms the single-source SE counterparts (with a bone- or air-conducted signal only) in various speech evaluation metrics. In addition, the adoption of an LF strategy other than an EF in this novel SE multi-modal structure achieves better results.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.3000968","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9112325","Multi-modal;bone/air-conducted signals;speech enhancement;fully convolutional network;fusion strategy","Noise measurement;Speech enhancement;Task analysis;Training;Time-domain analysis;Convolution","","45","","48","IEEE","9 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We consider two sparse array designs -SCOBA and SCOBAR - proposed recently and investigate the sparsity of their acquisition apertures and sub-apertures. We constructively formulate the problem of designing sparse arrays using fundamental properties from Minkowski algebra. Our investigation leads to two novel super-sparse array designs, which are sparser than SCOBA and SCOBAR and computationally more efficient for performing convolutional beamforming.

However, without prior knowledge of the transient duration, performance degrades due to mismatch and the spread of transient energy over frequency bins as a result.

One of the causes for this unwanted behaviour lies in the use of the standard softmax operator which pushes the posterior probabilities to be either zero or unity hence failing to model uncertainty. The statistical derivation of the softmax operator relies on the assumption that the distributions of the latent variables for a given class are Gaussian with known variance. However, it is possible to use different assumptions in the same derivation and attain from other families of distributions as well. This allows derivation of novel operators with more favourable properties. Here, a novel operator is proposed that is derived using t-distributions which are capable of providing a better description of uncertainty. It is shown that classifiers that adopt this novel operator can be more robust to out of distribution samples, often outperforming NNs that use the standard softmax operator. These enhancements can be reached with minimal changes to the NN architecture.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.3001843","Innosuisse - Schweizerische Agentur für Innovationsförderung(grant numbers:27674.1.PFES-ES-SHAPED); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9115250","Neural networks;out of distribution detection;confidence measures;  $t$  -distribution;classification algorithms","Artificial neural networks;Gaussian distribution;Uncertainty;Training;Standards;Reliability","","3","","33","IEEE","11 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many conventional methods perform thresholding for detection prior to tracking, which severely limits tracking performance at a low signal-to-noise ratio. In contrast, the proposed PF can operate directly on unthresholded sensor signals. Though there also exist methods applicable to unthresholded sensor signals called track-before-detect (TBD), the proposed PF has significant advantages over them. First, it is general without any restrictions on the form of a function that maps each target's states to its signal (e.g., disjoint, binary) or on the statistics of observation noise (e.g., Gaussian). Second, it can track an unknown, time-varying number of targets without knowing their initial states owing to Septier et al.'s state modeling with a birth/death process. The proposed PF includes Salmond et al.'s TBD PF for at most one target as a particular instance up to some implementation details. We present a simulation example in the context of radio-frequency tomography, where the proposed PF significantly outperformed Nannuru et al.'s state-of-the-art method based on random finite sets in terms of the optimal subpattern assignment (OSPA) metric.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.3002704","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9117147","Multi-target tracking;track-before-detect;particle filter;superpositional sensor signals","Target tracking;Signal to noise ratio;Particle filters;Radio frequency;Indexes;Signal processing algorithms;Indium tin oxide","","29","","43","IEEE","15 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We address this issue, and propose a statistical model for shape-based colocalization analysis. Our solution is a generalization of the Ripley's K-function for arbitrary shapes, and provides a method to statistically interpret the coupling of molecules to biological objects which are implicitly represented via level set embedding.

However, those typical CNN-based denoisers had two main limitations: (1) the superb denoising performances for AWGN do not necessarily carry over to the signal-dependent real-noise cases and (2) the clean source images are required as targets for supervised training. Both limitations are critical in practical real-noise denoising setting, since neither the noise characteristics nor the clean source images are readily available for supervised training. While some recent work proposed CNN denoisers that are trained solely with noisy images, they still fall short of the classical baselines, e.g., BM3D, for blind real-noise denoising settings, in which nothing is known about the noise and only noisy images are available for training. In this paper, we propose Blind Pixelwise Affine Image DEnoiser (BP-AIDE), which tackles above two limitations by combining variance stabilizing transformation (VST) technique with a recently developed unbiased estimate of the mean-squared error (MSE) for a pixelwise affine denoiser. As a result, we show BP-AIDE can be blindly trained solely with single real-noise corrupted images and, to the best of our knowledge, first outperforms both CNN-based and conventional denoisers for the same setting, on several real-world noisy image benchmark datasets.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.3002652","IITP grant funded by the Korea government(grant numbers:2016-0-00563,2019-0-00421,2019-0-01396,IITP-2020-2018-0-01798); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9117146","Convolutional neural networks;image denoising;source-dependenet real-world noise;unbiased estimator;variance stabilizing transformation","Noise measurement;Noise reduction;Training;AWGN;Neural networks;Computational modeling;Transforms","","7","","29","IEEE","15 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"On Recoverability of Randomly Compressed Tensors With Low CP Rank","S. Ibrahim; X. Fu; X.

The considered problem is well-motivated in many applications, e.g., hyperspectral image and video compression. Prior work studied this problem under a variety of assumptions, e.g., that the latent factors of the tensor are sparse and that the compressing matrix follows a joint absolutely continuous distribution. These results leverage analytical tools such as CPD uniqueness and algebraic geometry—which are elegant. In this work, we offer an alternative result: We show that if the tensor is compressed by a subgaussian linear mapping, then the tensor is recoverable if the number of measurements is on the same order of magnitude as that of the model parameters. Unlike existing results, our proof is based on deriving a restricted isometry property (R.I.P.) under the CPD model via set covering techniques, and thus exhibits a flavor of classic compressive sensing. The new recoverability result enriches the understanding to the compressed CP tensor recovery problem. It offers theoretical guarantees for recovering tensors whose elements are not necessarily sparse; the compressing matrix is also not restricted to continuous matrices under our framework. The newly derived covering number for tensors with low CP rank may also benefit future research, e.g., sketching based tensor compression for reducing computational burden.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.3003252","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:NSF-ECCS 1808159,NSF III 1910118); Army Research Office(grant numbers:ARO W911NF-19-1-0247); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9119759","Compressive sensing;canonical polyadic decomposition;CPD least squares","Tensors;Sensors;Image coding;Inverse problems;Sparse matrices;Hyperspectral imaging","","2","","33","IEEE","17 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To have a simple guideline for this optimization problem, we reformulate it into two separate problems, which are a fourth order sum coarray optimization problem and a second order difference coarray problem. The fourth order sum coarray optimization is realized by solving a postage stamp problem and a virtual nested array can be obtained. The number of elements in this virtual nested array can be significantly increased with only a few physical sensors. The corresponding inter-element spacing of virtual nested array is expanded simultaneously.

In this letter, the RSS based localization problem when the transmit power is unknown, is addressed based on the least squared relative error (LSRE) estimation. By taking exponential transformation, the original log-normal RSS measurement model is transformed into a multiplicative model, which is used to formulate a non-convex LSRE estimation problem with the source location and the transmit power as variables. We then apply semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to the non-convex LSRE problem to obtain a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. To facilitate SDR, we introduce two compound variables constructed by the source location and the transmit power, and then estimate the two compound variables instead of directly estimating the source location and the transmit power. The source location estimate is recovered according to its relation with the compound variable. Both simulations and real field test demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over several existing methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.3005298","Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Education Department(grant numbers:Y201636753); Research Development Fund of Zhejiang Wanli University; K.

Therefore, the methods are particularly vulnerable to solving the problem of blind SR, which deals with a real low-resolution (LR) image that does not follow the assumption. Recently, to address this issue, several internal learning-based methods, which train an image-specific network using a single input image, have been introduced. In this approach, the blind SR is modeled as a two-stage optimization problem, which conducts downscaling kernel estimation followed by SR network training with the estimated kernel. In this letter, we assume that not only the estimated kernel can be employed for SR network training, but also the super-resolved image can contribute to downscaling kernel estimation. To that end, we propose a unified internal learning-based blind SR method that jointly trains two image-specific networks for 1) downscaling together with kernel estimation and 2) SR. More specifically, we train the two networks to minimize a dual back-projection loss; the SR network is trained to reconstruct a given input image from the LR image generated by the downscaling network, and the downscaling network is trained to downscale the high-resolution image generated by the SR network to be as close as possible to the given input image. Through the complementary training, the downscaling kernel estimation becomes more accurate, resulting in better SR performance. In the experiment, we show that the proposed method outperforms previous two-stage internal learning-based methods in terms of both SR performance and efficiency.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.3005043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9126132","Super-resolution;blind super-resolution;internal learning","Kernel;Training;Estimation;Convolution;Image color analysis","","28","","27","IEEE","25 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the other hand, it is likely to generate over-exposure images. To mitigate these issues, we have developed a novel aggregated Retinex propagations to simultaneously correct over and under-exposure correction of a single image.

The existing QPC schemes focus on quantization parameter allocation, however, ignore the adaptation of Lagrangian multiplier to prediction structure, inter-layer residual dependency and layer-different quantization parameters (QPs). The misalignment of employed Lagrangian multiplier to the optimal one restricts the performance of QPC methods. To promote QPC schemes to their best performance, we propose a Lagrangian multiplier adaptation method based on accurate hyperbolic R-D model, distortion-QP model and rate-QP model. The derived Lagrangian multiplier is adaptive to residual characteristics under different prediction structures and QPC methods.

We find that a simple optimisation of the training label set improves recognition performance without additional computation. We discover that most of the improvement comes from ignoring a critical tiny portion of the missing labels.

It is known that the choice of MFCC as the only feature for voice activity detection (VAD) does not yield substantial improvements in the performance. Even with the long-term approach, we observe a not so encouraging VAD performance when MFCC features are employed.

More critically, these SR models often contain a huge number of parameters and may not meet the requirements of computation resources in real-world applications. To address the above issues, we propose a Hierarchical Neural Architecture Search (HNAS) method to automatically design promising architectures with different requirements of computation cost. To this end, we design a hierarchical SR search space and propose a hierarchical controller for architecture search. Such a hierarchical controller is able to simultaneously find promising cell-level blocks and network-level positions of upsampling layers.

Most of the existing algorithms report their denoising performance by comparing the original EEG signal and the reconstructed EEG signal using root mean square error (RMSE) and other similar measures. However, it is very important to quantify the distortion in each band of EEG signal since each band provides distinct information about the specific brain activity. Furthermore, quantification of band-wise distortion enables the selection of particular denoising algorithm for the application-specific EEG signal analysis. Therefore, in this paper, we propose two robust distortion measures such as weighted signal to noise ratio (WSNR) and weighted correlation coefficient (WCC) for accurately representing the objective reconstruction loss in each band. These performance measures are computed between the wavelet subbands of the original and the denoised/reconstructed signal with weights equal to the relative wavelet energy and wavelet entropy of the corresponding subband wavelet coefficients. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed performance measures, we evaluate the performance of six existing denoising methods using these measures. Results depict that these measures can adequately provide high mutual agreement between objective scores and subjective analysis.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.3006417","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9133280","Electroencephalogram (EEG);distortion measures;wavelet subband energy;wavelet entropy","Task analysis;Workstations;Stochastic processes;Programming;Uncertainty;Approximation methods;Reactive power","","30","","29","IEEE","3 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Over the past several decades, lots of effective methods have been established in the literature, and each method may contain several hyper-parameters. For a partial matrix, one can use those methods with certain parametric settings to obtain a large number of completions. Now, a critical question is, how to select the optimal completion from a number of candidates? This question is indeed a hard to answer, because in practice the true values of the missing entries are unknown. Thus far, the only approach for dealing with the issue is through data-validation, which is to first split the observations into two subsets, a training set and a validation set, and then choose the model that performs best on the validation set as the winner to produce the final results. Though straightforward, this approach might fall in a non-optimal model that overfits the validation set. In this work, we shall suggest a different approach called self-validation, which accounts on a special metric that can evaluate the “goodness” of a completion without using any validation data. The metric is derived from the recently established isomeric condition, measuring the identifiable degree of the completion itself. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our self-validation approach is better than the commonly used data-validation.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.3008043","New Generation AI Major Project of Ministry of Science and Technology of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0102501); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61825601,61532009); SenseTime Research Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9136847","Matrix completion;identifiability measure;self-validation;isomeric condition","Matrix decomposition;Pollution measurement;Motion pictures;Databases;Training;Automation","","1","","25","IEEE","8 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A typical voice conversion system employs a generator-vocoder pipeline, where the generator is responsible for conversion, and the vocoder is for waveform reconstruction. We propose a novel Multi-Task WaveRNN with an integrated architecture for cross-lingual voice conversion. The WaveRNN is trained on two sets of monolingual data via a two-task learning.

In many real-world applications, the outlier samples contaminated by noisy signal or spottiness have negative effects on the classification and clustering performance. To address this issue, we propose to develop a novel capped $\ell _p$-norm LDA model for robust dimension reduction against to outliers specifically. Proposed method integrates the capped $\ell _p$-norm based loss into the objective, which not only suppresses the light outliers but also works well even though the training set is contaminated seriously.

State-of-the-art methods, based on the two-branch-based architecture, rely on pre-calculated optical flows to provide motion information. However, this two-stage strategy is computationally intensive, storage demanding, and not task-oriented, which hampers it from being deployed in real-world applications. Albeit there have been numerous attempts to explore other motion representations to replace optical flows, most of the methods were designed for third-person activities, without capturing fine-grained cues. To tackle these issues, in this letter, we propose a progressive motion representation distillation (PMRD) method, based on two-branch networks, for egocentric activity recognition. We exploit a generalized knowledge distillation framework to train a hallucination network, which receives RGB frames as input and produces motion cues guided by the optical-flow network. Specifically, we propose a progressive metric loss, which aims to distill local fine-grained motion patterns in terms of each temporal progress level. To further enforce the proposed distillation framework to concentrate on those informative frames, we integrate a temporal attention mechanism into the metric loss. Moreover, a multi-stage training procedure is employed for the efficient learning of the hallucination network. Experimental results on three egocentric activity benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.3011326","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9146209","Egocentric activity recognition;knowledge distillation;two-branch networks;motion representation","Optical imaging;Optical network units;Optical signal processing;Optical losses;Training;Measurement","","3","","25","IEEE","22 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, existing LRR based methods have two common limitations: 1) they adopt graph regularization that only considers simple pairwise similarities among data points, and 2) they do not generally characterize the importance of each view. In this letter, we correspondingly utilize hypergraph regularization and a self-weighting strategy to handle the limitations with an LRR based model. Specifically, in our model, we construct hypergraph Laplacian matrices of each view that explicitly contain high order relations among data points, to improve the usage of complementary information. Meanwhile, the self-weighting strategy that preserves view specific information and assigns adaptive weights to each view is leveraged to take full advantage of multi-view consensus information. Based on the Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier (ALM) scheme, we design an effective alternating iterative strategy to optimize the model.

It assumes the same loss for different classification errors and aims to attain a low error rate by maximizing the cross-view correlation. However, in some real-world applications, different classification errors will lead to unequal misclassification losses. In addition, in practice, only limited cost label information is available in training set due to the expensive costs of labelling. This paper aims to perform label propagation with CCA in a unified cost-sensitive learning framework. By learning jointly, both the label propagation and CCA can feed back to each other. Thus, more discriminative and cost-sensitive projections will be learned for feature fusion. We test the proposed method on the cost-sensitive application of door-locker system based on multi-view face recognition.

According to the difference between the correlation between signals and noise in the received data, the single-channel data is converted into multi-channel data by a multi-channelization method without changing the signals. Then the noise is filtered by correlation calculation of multi-channel data, which can improve the detection probability of signals under low SNR. Based on the theory of multi-channelization, we propose two different methods to detect signals. To better reflect the performance of the algorithm, we compared several classical signal detection methods, such as energy detection (ED), correlation detection (CD), and cyclic spectrum detection (CSD).

A recent very popular approach to recovering a low-rank matrix X is to factorize it as a product of two smaller matrices, i.e., X = UVT, and then optimize over U, V instead of X. Despite the resulting non-convexity, recent results have shown that many factorized objective functions actually have benign global geometry-with no spurious local minima and satisfying the so-called strict saddle property-ensuring convergence to a global minimum for many local-search algorithms. Such results hold whenever the original objective function is restricted strongly convex and smooth. However, most of these results actually consider a modified cost function that includes a balancing regularizer. While useful for deriving theory, this balancing regularizer does not appear to be necessary in practice. In this work, we close this theory-practice gap by proving that the unaltered factorized non-convex problem, without the balancing regularizer, also has similar benign global geometry. Moreover, we also extend our theoretical results to the field of distributed optimization.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.3008876","NSF(grant numbers:CCF-1704204); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)(grant numbers:N660011824020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9141202","Low-rank matrix recovery;non-convex optimization;geometric landscape;centralized optimization;distributed optimization","Cost function;Linear programming;Geometry;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Signal processing;Machine learning","","13","","32","IEEE","15 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Besides, dark channel prior is invalid for highlight areas such as white objects, and it also causes distortion. In this letter, we design a delicate function to replace minimum filter operation, and its purpose is to fundamentally avoid the errors of edge assignment. The function includes two pieces: power-law transform compresses low-luminance regions, and linear attenuation retains original characteristics of bright parts in the image.

To overcome this limitation, this letter proposes a novel self-supervised DSLF reconstruction method, CycleST, which employs ST and cycle consistency. Specifically, CycleST is composed of an encoder-decoder network and a residual learning strategy that restore the shearlet coefficients of densely-sampled EPIs using EPI-reconstruction and cycle-consistency losses. CycleST is a self-supervised approach that can be trained solely on Sparsely-Sampled Light Fields (SSLFs) with small disparity ranges ($\leqslant$ 8 pixels).

Due to the wide beam width of antenna, the ship detection of the UHF radar suffers from the broaden river clutters scattering from water waves. In addition, due to the high resolution, the ship echoes are seriously extended in both range and Doppler dimensions, which is different from the traditional point target signal. Extended target detection in strong river clutter is applied in this letter. Conventional constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector is limited in this situation, which is applicable to the point target detection in clutter free background.

But, frequency domain processing suffers from aliasing, and brings inconveniences when handling certain time domain properties like nonstationarity, and sparsity. We propose novel time, and z-domain costs for such PCA, and study its properties in detail with setting of either finite or diverging filter lengths.

However, periocular images only capture the least salient face features, and thus suffering from severe intra-class compactness and inter-class dispersion issues for discriminative deep feature learning. Recently, label smoothing regularization (LSR) is discerned capable of diminishing the intra-class variation by minimizing the Kullback-Liebler divergence of a uniform distribution and a network prediction distribution. In this letter, we extend LSR to that of Generalized LSR (GLSR) by learning a pre-task network prediction, in place of the predefined uniform distribution. Extensive experiments on four periocular in the wild datasets disclose that the GSLR-trained networks prevail over the LSR-based counterpart and other most recent the state of the arts.

However, it suffers from slow tracking speed for a system change suddenly, because it can not distinguish between the time-varying system and occurrence of the impulsive noise. To overcome this problem, the proposed algorithm is induced from the matrix inequalities in no impulsive interference. The proposed algorithm determines the necessity for updating the weight vector in the noise. Hence, it has robustness and tracking ability because it discriminates between the time-varying system and occurrence of the impulsive noise.

A seed is a clue to ease the ambiguity of the problem by making the object segmentation task interactive. However, in most deep network-based works, seed information has been used as an additional channel for input images. In this paper, we propose a novel bi-directional attention module for more actively using seed information. The proposed bi-directional seed attention module (BSA) operates based on the feature map of the segmentation network and the input seed map. Through our attention module, the network feature map is affected by the seed map, while the feature also updates the seed information. As a result, our system concentrates on the seed information and more accurately derives the segmentation result required by the user. We have conducted validation experiments on the four standard benchmark datasets, including SBD, GrabCut, Berkeley, and DAVIS, and achieved the state-of-the-art results.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.3019970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9178957","Attention;deep network;interactive segmentation","Image segmentation;Bidirectional control;Semantics;Decoding;Silicon compounds;Signal processing algorithms;Perturbation methods","","5","","34","IEEE","27 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this issue, we propose to model the label dependencies via a graph-based method, where each node of the graph represents a label. An adjacency matrix is constructed by mining the statistical relations between labels to represent the graph structure information, and a graph convolutional network (GCN) is employed to learn node representations by propagating information between neighboring nodes based on the adjacency matrix, which implicitly models the label dependencies.

Modern PF applications have demanding accuracy and run-time constraints that can be addressed through parallel computing. However, an efficient parallelization of PFs can only be achieved by effectively parallelizing the bottleneck: resampling and its constituent redistribution step. A pre-existing implementation of redistribute on Shared Memory Architectures (SMAs) achieves O(NT log2N) time complexity over T parallel cores. This redistribute implementation is, however, highly computationally intensive and cannot be effectively parallelized due to the inherently limited number of cores of SMAs. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel redistribute on OpenMP 4.5 which takes O(N/T + log2N) steps and fully exploits the computational power of SMAs. The proposed approach is up to six times faster than the O(N/T log2N) one and its implementation on GPU provides a further three-time speed-up vs its equivalent on a 32-core CPU.

Although semantic segmentation neural networks can transfer knowledge from seen classes to unseen classes by incorporating the class-level semantic information, it shows a strong bias towards seen classes. In this letter, we propose an easy-to-implement transductive approach to alleviate the prediction bias in zero-shot semantic segmentation.

In this context, reduced reference metrics aim to predict the visual quality of the transmitted contents, while requiring only a small set of features to be sent in addition to the streamed media. In this paper, we propose a reduced reference metric to predict the quality of point cloud contents under compression distortions. To do so, we extract a small set of statistical features from the reference point cloud in the geometry, color and normal vector domain, which can be used at the receiver side to assess the visual degradation of the content. Using publicly available ground-truth datasets, we compare the performance of our metric to widely-used full reference metrics.

Despite promising results of existing domain adaptation methods, they have a strong constraint where the source and target samples are accessible during a training phase. However, direct usage of source samples possibly causes data-privacy issues especially when each label of source domain acts as an individual's identifier such as biometric information. To address data-privacy problems in conventional domain adaptation, we propose privacy-preserving domain adaptation (PPDA). Our main hypothesis is that if we train our target model initialized from a pre-trained source model in a self-learning manner, we can successfully transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. In our preliminary study, we observe that target samples with low self-entropy measured from the pre-trained source model achieves sufficiently high accuracy. From this key observation, we first select the reliable samples based on self-entropy and define them as class prototypes. We then assign pseudo labels to the target samples through the similarity between target samples and class prototypes. To further reduce the uncertainty of the pseudo labeling process, we also introduce a sample-level reweighting scheme. Surprisingly, our PPDA model outperforms conventional domain adaptation methods on public datasets even though we do not directly access any source data.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.3025112","National Research Foundation of Korea; Korea government(grant numbers:2020R1F1A1065573); Inha University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9200758","Domain adaptation;pre-trained model;self-learning;pseudo labels;class prototypes","Prototypes;Reliability;Adaptation models;Feature extraction;Data models;Data privacy;Training","","14","","41","IEEE","18 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A crucial step in dehazing is the recovery of the global air-light vector. Traditional methods usually interpret the RGB value of the brightest region in haze images as the air-light. In this letter, a new prior called ‘color constancy prior’ has been proposed to improve the robustness of air-light estimation when varicolored illumination exists. The prior utilizes the statistical observation that distant scenery objects become the most haze-opaque due to the pixel escalation towards the higher intensity side. The comparative evaluation on a variety of haze images manifests that the proposed prior perform better than existing air-light recovery methods and can be used for subsequent dehazing applications.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.3025462","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9201388","Air-light estimation;dehazing","Estimation;Image color analysis;Atmospheric modeling;Indexes;Brightness;Computational modeling;Channel estimation","","13","","21","IEEE","21 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we propose to use multiple generators that are chained to perform multi-stage enhancement mapping, which gradually refines the noisy input signals in a stage-wise fashion. Furthermore, we study two scenarios: (1) the generators share their parameters and (2) the generators' parameters are independent. The former constrains the generators to learn a common mapping that is iteratively applied at all enhancement stages and results in a small model footprint. On the contrary, the latter allows the generators to flexibly learn different enhancement mappings at different stages of the network at the cost of an increased model size. We demonstrate that the proposed multi-stage enhancement approach outperforms the one-stage SEGAN baseline, where the independent generators lead to more favorable results than the tied generators.

More specifically, an anomalous labeled video may actually contain anomaly only in a short duration while the rest of the video frames may be normal. In the current work, we propose a weakly supervised anomaly detection framework based on deep neural networks which is trained in a self-reasoning fashion using only video-level labels. To carry out the self-reasoning based training, we generate pseudo labels by using binary clustering of spatio-temporal video features which helps in mitigating the noise present in the labels of anomalous videos. Our proposed formulation encourages both the main network and the clustering to complement each other in achieving the goal of more accurate anomaly detection.

And it is shown to be upper bounded by the minimum between the LIS size and a value explicitly dependent on the target receiver signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The upper bound gives the condition on the target SNR for achieving overhead saving compared to the full CSI scheme. And the overhead saving increases linearlywith the LIS size for constant target SNR. Non-negligible overhead saving is still available even though one increases the target SNR with larger LIS, e.g., as the square of the LIS size for fully exploiting the beamforming gain.

Our results also explain the importance of commonly used strategies in the design and training of neural networks such as “weight decay” and “path-norm” regularization, and provide a new justification for the use of “skip connections” in network architectures.

In particular, we show how neural network training problems are related to infinite-dimensional optimizations posed over Banach spaces of functions whose solutions are well-known to be fractional and polynomial splines, where the particular Banach space (which controls the order of the spline) depends on the choice of activation function.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.3027517","AFOSR/AFRL(grant numbers:FA9550-18-1-0166); NSF Research Traineeship(grant numbers:1545481); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9209059","Neural networks;regularization;activation functions;inverse problems","Splines (mathematics);Training;Biological neural networks;Green's function methods;Inverse problems;Feedforward neural networks","","82","","25","IEEE","29 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, by assuming one-bit transmitted signals at the base station (BS), which arises from the use of low-resolution DACs in the regime of massive transmit antennas, a joint design of one-bit SLP at the BS and the phase shifts at the IRS is proposed with a goal of minimizing the worst-case symbol error probability (SEP) of the users under the PSK modulation. This joint design problem is essentially a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP). To tackle it, we alternately optimize the one-bit signal and the phase shifts. For the former, a dual of the relaxed one-bit SLP problem is solved by the mirror descent (MD) method with the maximum block improvement (MBI) heuristics. For the latter, the accelerated projected gradient (APG) method is employed to optimize the phases. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed joint design can attain better SEP performance than the conventional linear precoding and one-bit SLP.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.3028029","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61531009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9210213","Intelligent reflecting surface;passive beamforming;symbol-level precoding;symbol-error probability","Precoding;Downlink;Phase shift keying;MIMO communication;MISO communication;Wireless communication;Mirrors","","14","","23","IEEE","30 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The only existing method available-data validation-addresses the problem based on the validation set. While straightforward, this method may lead to a nonoptimal model, especially in scenarios with high missing ratios, and noise.

In acoustical applications a first order Markov model is often used to describe the time-variant nature of transversal filters. The Kalman filter is the optimal unbiased estimator for such a Markov model. It inherently calculates the uncertainty of the current state estimate by its state error covariance matrix. In contrast to the broadband Kalman filter the covariance matrix of the exact Kalman filter depends on properties of the input signal. The single step covariance update of the exact Kalman filter is a discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation. We propose a solution for the steady state covariance matrix, which depends on the process parameters of the Markov model as well as properties of the input signal. It is derived based on the eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix and the autocorrelation matrix of the input signal. The proposed algorithm converges in few iterations and gives accurate results.

Without box-level annotations, these methods cannot accurately locate objects. Considering an object may show different motion from its surrounding objects or background, we leverage motion information to improve the detection accuracy. However, the motion pattern of an object is complex. Different parts of an object may have different motion patterns, which poses challenges in exploring motion information for object localization. Directly using motion information may degrade the localization performance. To overcome these issues, we propose a Motion Context Network (MC-Net) in this letter. Our method generates motion context features by exploiting neighborhood motion correlation information on moving regions.

During the RANSAC process, the minimal set is randomly sampled by random tree spanning on the Epipolar-geometry Graph (EG). As the RANSAC estimation result is sensitive to the size of minimal set, the EG is clustered into several sub-graphs, and the inner- and inter-cluster RANSAC-based rotation averaging are performed hierarchically. In addition, both random generation and optimal selection of the minimal set are performed in a weighted manner to make the rotation averaging pipeline more robust.

Under this setup and considering that SR operates in amplify-and-forward (AF) or decode-and-forward (DF) mode, E aims to i) determine the optimal set of sub-channels for jamming and ii) optimize its jamming power over these sub-channels in order to deliberately force ST and SR reallocating power to the unjammed sub-channels to the most, so as to increase the perceived power of E over the unjammed sub-channels and then maximize the eavesdropping rate.

Since real-world 3D mesh-labeled datasets are limited, most current methods in 3D human shape reconstruction only focus on single RGB images, losing all the temporal information. In contrast, we propose temporally refined Graph U-Nets, including an image-level module and a video-level module, to solve this problem. The image-level module is Graph U-Nets for human shape and pose estimation from images, where the Graph Convolutional Neural Network (Graph CNN) helps the information communication of neighboring vertices, and the U-Nets architecture enlarges the receptive field of each vertex and fuses high-level and low-level features. The video-level module is a small Residual Temporal Graph CNN (Residual TG-CNN), which learns temporal dynamics from both structural and temporal neighbors. The temporal dynamics of each vertex are continuous in the temporal dimension and highly relevant to the structural neighbors, so it is helpful to diminish the ambiguity of the body in single images by fusing temporal dynamics. Our algorithm makes full use of labels from image-level datasets and refines the image-level results through video-level module.

Many studies have indicated that facial emotion changes are strongly related to certain regions of interest (ROIs), such as the mouth, eyes, eyebrows, and nose; therefore, the features of these facial ROIs are very important for identifying expressions. Since Gabor filters are very efficient in extracting visual content, Gabor orientation filters (GoFs) modulated by Gabor kernels and traditional convolutional filters can capture such ROI information better than conventional convolutional filters. Consequently, this letter presents a light Gabor convolutional network (GCN) consisting of only four Gabor convolutional layers and two linear layers for FER tasks.

Inspired by the great success of the convolutional neural network (CNN) for the problem of image restoration, learned features have been widely adopted for shadow detection. However, most existing methods still suffer from ambiguities driven by black-colored objects, which are not actually shaded, as well as the background clutter. In this letter, we propose the attentive feedback feature pyramid network (AFFPN) for shadow detection in a single image. The key idea of the proposed method is to extract shadow-relevant features based on multiple feedback modules, which are defined in the feature pyramid network. Specifically, attentive features extracted from each level of the encoder are progressively refined via connections between feedback modules from high-level to low-level layers for learning properties of shadow more accurately. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method is effective for shadow detection under complicated real-world environments.

Best- and breadth-first searches have been used as decoding strategies for RNN-T. However, best-first search follows a sequential process for its expansion search, which slows down the decoding process. Although breadth-first search replaces the sequential process of best-first search with a parallel one, it unnecessarily conducts an expansion search for all decoding steps. As most of the decoding frames correspond to a blank symbol because the length of the character sequence is much shorter than that of the decoding frames, this induces computational overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce an adaptive expansion search (AES) to accelerate RNN-T inference. AES overcomes the aforementioned limitations by batching the hypotheses and adopting a decision-making process that decides whether to continue the expansion search; thus, AES can avoid unnecessary expansion search. Furthermore, pruning is applied to AES for further acceleration. We achieved significant speedup and a lower word error rate compared with other baselines.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.3036335","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9250505","Beam search;RNN transducer","Decoding;Speech recognition;Acoustic beams;Acceleration;Acoustics;Speech processing;Indexes","","14","","18","IEEE","6 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, meta-learning based methods have been shown is promising for FSIC. Commonly, they train a meta-learner to learn easy fine-tuning weight for FSIC. When solving an FSIC task, the meta-learner efficiently updates itself on few images of the task and turns to a task-specific model. In this letter, we propose a novel meta-learning based layer-wise adaptive updating (LWAU) method for FSIC. LWAU is inspired by an interesting finding that compared with common deep models, the meta-learners pay much more attention to update their top layers when learning from few images. According to this finding, we assume that the meta-learners may greatly prefer updating their top layers to updating their bottom layers for better FSIC performance. Therefore, in LWAU, the meta-learner is trained to learn not only the easy fine-tuning weight but also its favorite layer-wise adaptive updating rule. Extensive experiments show that compared with existing few-shot classification methods, the proposed LWAU: 1) achieves better FSIC performance with a clear margin; 2) almost updates only its top layer when solving FSIC, which indicates the learned feature extractor is much more generalizable; 3) learns sparser feature extractor; 4) learns from few images more efficiently by at least 5 times.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.3036348","National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research(grant numbers:2020YFC2003901); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61573286); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9250503","Deep learning;few-shot image classification;layer-wise adaptive updating;meta-learning","Adaptation models;Visualization;Computer vision;Image recognition;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Image classification","","8","","43","IEEE","6 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, this letter proposes a novel VRF generation convolutional neural network (VRFCNN) to jointly handle enhancement of corresponding BL frame and compensation of previous EL frame.

Then, the one-bit CS with binary measurements is proposed to save the bit budget, but it is infeasible when the energy information of signals is not available as a prior knowledge. Subsequently, the hybrid CS which combines traditional CS and one-bit CS appears, striking a balance between the pros and cons of both types of CS. Given that one-bit CS is optimal for the direction estimation of signals under noise with a fixed bit budget and that traditional CS is able to provide residue information and estimated signals, we focus on the design of greedy algorithms, which consist of the main steps of support detection and recovered signal updates, for hybrid CS in this paper. We propose two greedy algorithms for hybrid CS, with traditional CS offering signal estimates and updated residues, which help one-bit CS detect the support iteratively.

To alleviate these problems, this letter presents a simple yet effective method for enhancing the performance of the SR without requiring significant modifications to the original SR network. To this end, we present a self-selective concatenation (SSC), which is a substitute for the conventional feature concatenation. In the upsampling layers of the SR network, the SSC extracts spatial and channel attention from both color and depth features such that color features can be selectively used for depth SR. Specifically, the SSC learns to use sufficient color features for rendering sharp depth boundaries, whereas their effects are reduced in smooth regions to prevent texture-copying. The proposed SSC can be included in any existing SR networks that have the encoder-decoder structure.

Recently, some fine-grained hashing methods have been proposed to capture the subtle differences, which mainly utilize the single-modality visual features to solve the discriminative region localization while ignoring the semantic information. In this letter, we propose a correlation filtering hashing (CFH) method to learn discrete binary codes, which can adequately take advantage of the cross-modal correlation between the semantic information and the visual features for discriminative region localization. Specifically, we utilize a feature pyramid network to learn multi-level visual features. Subsequently, the label vector is embedded into the visual space, which can be used as a correlation filter on the feature maps to capture the latent location of objects. Finally, weperform global average pooling over the output maps and concatenate the features of different levels to produce the hash codes of query images.

In this letter, a novel CNN, called the local and global priors network (LGPNet), is proposed that simultaneously learns both the local and the global priors for removing compression image artifacts. To achieve this goal, a dual-attention unit (DAU) is developed and incorporated into the well-known U-Net architecture for learning a better local prior.

The similarity-preserving knowledge distillation makes pairwise similarities from a compact student network similar to those from a teacher network. The pairwise similarity measured on spatial, channel, and batch units enables to transfer knowledge of the teacher to the student. Based on the similarity-preserving knowledge distillation, we not only design a lighter and smaller student network than the teacher one but also achieve superior performance compared to that of the student network without the knowledge distillation.

In order to improve the performance of the E2E model, the local and sequential properties of speech should be efficiently taken into account when modelling. However, in most current E2E models for SE, these properties are either not fully considered or are too complex to be realized. In this letter, we propose an efficient E2E SE model, termed WaveCRN. Compared with models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) or long short-term memory (LSTM), WaveCRN uses a CNN module to capture the speech locality features and a stacked simple recurrent units (SRU) module to model the sequential property of the locality features. Different from conventional recurrent neural networks and LSTM, SRU can be efficiently parallelized in calculation, with even fewer model parameters. In order to more effectively suppress noise components in the noisy speech, we derive a novel restricted feature masking approach, which performs enhancement on the feature maps in the hidden layers; this is different from the approaches that apply the estimated ratio mask to the noisy spectral features, which is commonly used in speech separation methods. Experimental results on speech denoising and compressed speech restoration tasks confirm that with the SRU and the restricted feature map, WaveCRN performs comparably to other state-of-the-art approaches with notably reduced model complexity and inference time.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.3040693","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9272838","Compressed speech restoration;convolutional recurrent neural networks;raw waveform speech enhancement;simple recurrent unit","Speech enhancement;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Noise reduction;Convolution;Noise measurement;Training","","65","","50","CCBY","27 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we present a psychoacoustic calibration scheme to re-define the loss functions of neural audio coding systems so that it can decode signals more perceptually similar to the reference, yet with a much lower model complexity. The proposed loss function incorporates the global masking threshold, allowing the reconstruction error that corresponds to inaudible artifacts.
