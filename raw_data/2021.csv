Robust Downlink Transmit Optimization Under Quantized Channel Feedback via the Strong Duality for QCQP,X. Lin; Y. Huang; W. -K. Ma,"School of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; School of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,15 Jan 2021,2021,28,,1,5,"Consider a robust multiple-input single-output downlink beamforming optimization problem in a frequency division duplexing system. The base station (BS) sends training signals to the users, and every user estimates the channel coefficients, quantizes the gain and the direction of the estimated channel and sends them back to the BS. Suppose that the channel state information at the transmitter is imperfectly known mainly due to the channel direction quantization errors, channel estimation errors and outdated channel effects. The actual channel is modeled as in an uncertainty set composed of two inequality homogeneous and one equality inhomogeneous quadratic constraints, in order to account for the aforementioned errors and effects. Then the transmit power minimization problem is formulated subject to robust signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio constraints. Each robust constraint is transformed equivalently into a quadratic matrix inequality (QMI) constraint with respect to the beamforming vectors. The transformation is accomplished by an equivalent phase rotation process and the strong duality result for a quadratically constrained quadratic program. The minimization problem is accordingly turned into a QMI problem, and the problem is solved by a restricted linear matrix inequality relaxation with additional valid convex constraints. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, and show the efficiency of the restricted relaxation.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2020.3037508,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11871168,U1701266); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9261099,Feedback path errors;frequency division duplexing system;quantized channel feedback;robust downlink beamforming;the strong duality of QCQP,Array signal processing;Channel estimation;Signal to noise ratio;Interference;Optimization;Downlink;Receivers,,3,,19,IEEE,16 Nov 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

To solve these problems, we propose a meta-learning based multi-source spatio-temporal network (Meta-MSNet). The Meta-MSNet is designed with an encoder-decoder structure.

Because of the charge trapping at photodiodes, lag signals occur at the sequentially acquired images and produce lag artifacts. To design low-lag detectors, accurately measuring an amount of the lag signal is important. In the standard of IEC62220-1-3, a lag correction factor (LCF) is measured to obtain a true noise power spectrum, in which a temporal power spectral density (PSD) is employed using steady-state images. However, various noise signals can easily distort the PSD curve and cause erroneous measurements of LCF. In this letter, we propose a measurement algorithm for LCF using the correlation coefficients from steady-state images based on a linear lag model. This method can be a generalized version of a method that is based on the first-order regression model and has a characteristic that is resistant to various noises.

This letter presents a method to efficiently identify the relative acoustic impulse response between two microphones for TDOA estimation based on the so-called Kronecker product decomposition. By decomposing the relative impulse response into a series of Kronecker products of shorter filters, the original channel identification problem with a long impulse response is converted into one of identifying a number of short filters.

The weighted-prediction-error (WPE) method, which estimates the late reverberation component based on a multichannel linear predictor, is by far one of the most effective algorithms for dereverberation. Generally, the WPE prediction filter in every short-time-Fourier-transform (STFT) subband has to be long enough to estimate accurately the late reverberation component. As a consequence, WPE is computationally expensive, which makes it difficult to implement into real-time embedded or edge computing devices. Moreover, WPE is sensitive to additive noise and its performance may suffer from dramatic degradation even in environments where the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is high. To address these drawbacks, this letter proposes to decompose the multichannel linear prediction filter as a Kronecker product of a temporal (interframe) prediction filter and a spatial filter. An iterative algorithm is then developed to optimize the two filters. In comparison with the original WPE algorithm, the presented method not only exhibits better performance in terms of dereverberation and robustness to additive noise, as there are fewer parameters to estimate for a given number of observation signal samples, but is also computationally more efficient, since the dimensions of the covariance matrices after Kronecker product decomposition are smaller.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2020.3044796,"National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0102200); Key Program of National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61831019); NSFC and the Israel Science Foundation(grant numbers:61761146001,2514/17); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9293360,Beamforming;dereverberation;Kronecker product filter;noise robustness;speech enhancement;weighted-prediction-error,Reverberation;Computational complexity;Additive noise;Predictive models;Covariance matrices;Cost function;Array signal processing,,33,,37,IEEE,14 Dec 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

However, being autoregressive models, their computational complexity is still a prohibitive factor in their deployment into production systems. To amend this problem, we study two different non-autoregressive transformer structures for ASR: Audio-Conditional Masked Language Model (A-CMLM) and Audio-Factorized Masked Language Model (A-FMLM). When training these frameworks, the decoder input tokens are randomly replaced by special mask tokens. Then, the network is optimized to predict the masked tokens by taking both the unmasked context tokens and the input speech into consideration. During inference, we start from all masked tokens and the network iteratively predicts missing tokens based on partial results. A new decoding strategy is proposed as an example, which starts from the most confident predictions to the rest.

Recently, a new form of image enhancement has been proposed to complete the task without any information loss. Specifically, information required to restore the original image is reversibly hidden into the enhanced image. Moreover, several image segmentation based algorithms have been proposed so that the region of interest can be exclusively enhanced. However, with the reversible algorithms, it is hard to properly enhance the tissues in MR brain images when they are relatively small or connected with each other. To address this issue, a hierarchical CE scheme is proposed for MR brain images with reversibility in this letter. Firstly, a deep convolutional neural network is used to segment multiple tissue classes automatically. Then, the segmented tissues are individually utilized to guide the CE procedure so that individual-tissue-enhanced images are generated. Compared with using the background information to guide the CE procedure, better tissue enhancement effects and visual quality are both obtained by our proposed hierarchical scheme. The evaluation results obtained over MR brain test images demonstrate the reversibility and adaptability of the proposed scheme for the enhancement of interested tissues.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2020.3048840,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772208); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:x2js-D2190700); ARC(grant numbers:DP190103660,DP200103207,LP180100663); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9314240,Image segmentation;magnetic resonance image;medical image enhancement;reversible data hiding,Image segmentation;Histograms;Brain;Image enhancement;Signal processing algorithms;Image restoration;Magnetic resonance imaging,,20,,35,IEEE,5 Jan 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Among these methods, generative adversarial networks (GANs) using autoencoder as the generator have become the promising model for image inpainting. These models implement the end-to-end image inpainting and also generate visually reasonable and clear image structures and textures. However, GANs often have problems with gradient vanishing and model collapse during training, so we propose a Generative Adversarial Network with Evolutionary Generators (EG-GAN) and apply it in face image inpainting.

Thus, they cannot adequately tackle both absorption and scattering, leading to poor restoration results. To address this problem, we propose a novel two-stage network for underwater image restoration (UIR), which divides the restoration process into two parts viz. horizontal and vertical distortion restoration. In the first stage, a model-based network is proposed to handle horizontal distortion by directly embedding the underwater physical model into the network. The attenuation coefficient, as a feature representation in characterizing water type information, is first estimated to guide the accurate estimation of the parameters in the physical model. For the second stage, to tackle vertical distortion and reconstruct the clear underwater image, we put forth a novel attenuation coefficient prior attention block (ACPAB) to adaptively recalibrate the RGB channel-wise feature maps of the image suffering from the vertical distortion.

However, the node interaction through message propagation does not always provide complementary information. Instead, it May even produce destructive noise and thus make learned representations indistinguishable. Inevitably, the graph representation would also become over-smoothing especially when multiple GCN layers are stacked. This paper proposes spatial-temporal graph deconvolutional networks (ST-GDNs), a novel and flexible graph deconvolution technique, to alleviate this issue. At its core, this method provides a better message aggregation by removing the embedding redundancy of the input graphs from either node-wise, frame-wise or element-wise at different network layers.

A deep model having a softmax layer per coefficient is employed to parametrize the conditional distribution, and deep model parameters are found by minimizing a weighted sum of the cross-entropy between its outputs and respective target distributions. Experiments with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on publicly available noisy speech dataset obtained from the Voice Bank corpus show consistent improvement over conventional solutions based on the mean squared error (MSE), and the least absolute deviation (LAD).

Dark-Aware Network For Fine-Grained Sketch-Based Image Retrieval,Z. Yang; X. Zhu; J. Qian; P.

Among existing methods, edge-only information based ones are convenient to use but incompetent in distinguishing among ambiguous samples. On the other hand, even though the methods using additional color information can significantly improve the retrieval performance, they are not convenient for practical use as the increase of sketch complexity. This paper fills the gap between these two kinds of methods by proposing a novel method, namely dark-aware sketch-based image retrieval (DA-SBIR), which incorporates the dark region information of images into FG-SBIR without a sacrifice of convenience. Our model consists of two branches to process edge structure and dark region, respectively. Specifically, instead of using real color, DA-SBIR only requires some additional free-hand black sketch to represent the dark region. Besides, a Split Generative Adversarial Network is introduced to automatically split a sketch into edge-structure-only and dark-region-only sketches. Moreover, we build a new clothes dataset, SJTU-Cloth, with more ambiguous samples for FG-SBIR.

Hence, the variation of the reward should be considered to make the arm-selection process risk-aware. In this letter, the mean-variance metric is investigated to measure the uncertainty of the received rewards. We first study a risk-aware MAB problem when the reward follows a Gaussian distribution, and a concentration inequality on the variance is developed to design a Gaussian risk aware-upper confidence bound algorithm. Furthermore, we extend this algorithm to a novel asymptotic risk aware-upper confidence bound algorithm by developing an upper confidence bound of the variance based on the asymptotic distribution of the sample variance.

Advanced Siamese trackers perform well on certain benchmarks, but there are still some limitations. First, most Siamese trackers adopt the initial frame as a single template, which leads to underfitting and reduces the ability to predict instances. Second, mainstream trackers report a rectangular bounding box as a prediction, resulting in poor accuracy of non-rigid objects. Therefore, we propose the template enhancement and mask generation for Siamese tracking. Given that the essence of Siamese trackers is instance learning, we propose constructing an alternative template explicitly to address the underfitting of the instance space. Moreover, in order to improve the tracking accuracy, we obtain the descriptor aggregation to transform the semantic segmentation outputs for mask prediction.

Reconstruction of Periodic Signals From Asynchronous Trains of Samples,M. W. Rupniewski,"Institute of Electronic Systems, Warsaw University of Technology, Warszawa, Poland",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,9 Feb 2021,2021,28,,289,293,"A short train of equidistant samples rarely suffices to compute a reasonable approximation to a continuous-time signal. Hence, there arises a need for signal reconstruction methods that exploit multiple trains of samples. If the starting times of the trains are known, then stroboscopic techniques can be used for signal reconstruction. If these times are not given, i.e., in the case of asynchronous trains of samples, it is still possible to profit from multiple trains provided that the starting times are uniformly random when considered modulo the period of the signal. For such a scenario, it is known that an infinite set of sample trains allows for reconstruction of the signal up to a time shift provided that the sampling period is small enough and that the derivative of the signal satisfies some regularity conditions. In this paper, we generalize that discovery by showing that the regularity conditions concerning the derivative of the signal can be dropped. The reconstruction of the signal is still possible even if the derivative of the signal does not exist. We also show how to estimate the signal from a finite set of asynchronous trains of samples.

One disadvantage of using human-made criteria to prune filters is that the design and selection of threshold criteria depend on complicated prior knowledge. Besides, the pruning process is less robust due to the impact of directly regularizing on filters. To address the problems mentioned, we propose an effective one-stage pruning framework: introducing a trainable collaborative layer to jointly prune and learn neural networks in one go. In our framework, we first add a binary collaborative layer for each original filter. Then, a new type of gradient estimator - asymptotic gradient estimator is first introduced to pass the gradient in the binary collaborative layer. Finally, we simultaneously learn the sparse structure and optimize the weights from the original model in the training process.

Specifically, RGB chiefly reveals appearance and flow mainly depicts motion. Given RGB and flow features, previous methods employ the early fusion or late fusion paradigm to mine the complementarity between them. By concatenating raw RGB and flow features, the early fusion implicitly achieved complementarity by the network, but it partly discards the particularity of each modality. The late fusion independently maintains two branches to explore the particularity of each modality, but it only fuses the localization results, which is insufficient to mine the complementarity. In this work, we propose explicit cross-modality fusion (POLO) to effectively utilize the complementarity between two modalities and thoroughly explore the particularity of each modality. POLO performs cross-modality fusion via estimating the attention weight from RGB modality and employing it to flow modality (vice versa). This bridges the complementarity of one modality to supply the other. Assisted with the attention weight, POLO independently learns from RGB and flow features and explores the particularity of each modality. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate the preferable performance of POLO.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2021.3061289,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9362259,Feature fusion;frame-wise attention;mutual attention;temporal action localization,Videos;Location awareness;Convolutional neural networks;Training data;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Feature recognition,,27,,37,IEEE,24 Feb 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

In this letter, we propose a novel framework to generate adversarial examples where the actual image is not corrupted rather its latent space representation is utilized to tamper the inherent structure of the image while maintaining the perceptual quality intact and to act as legitimate data samples. As opposed to gradient-based attacks, the latent space poisoning exploits the inclination of classifiers to model the independent and identical distribution of the training dataset and tricks it by producing out of distribution samples. We train a disentangled variational autoencoder ($\beta$-VAE) to model the data in latent space and then we add noise perturbations using a class-conditioned distribution function to the latent space under the constraint that it is misclassified to the target label.

Generalizable Seizure Detection Model Using Generating Transferable Adversarial Features,S. Nasiri; G. D. Clifford,"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,29 Mar 2021,2021,28,,568,572,"Epilepsy is the second most common neurological disorder, affecting 65 million people around the world. It is associated with seizures - a sudden, uncontrolled electrical disturbance in the brain that can lead to profound transient changes in behavior, movements, feelings, and levels of consciousness. Current approaches to developing a generalized automated seizure detection algorithm rely on constructing large, labeled training and test corpora of electroencephalograms (EEGs) from different individuals. However, due to the inherent inter-subject variability, heterogeneity of acquisition hardware, different montage choices, and various recording environments, EEG patterns may exhibit very different distributions over time and between individuals. Therefore, training an algorithm on such data without accounting for this diversity can affect the performance of any classifier or predictor. In addition, this process smooths out individual differences, producing a general, but a non-specific model. To address these issues, we propose a novel method that generates transferable features to interpolate between features from the training and test sets. This is achieved by adversarially training deep classifiers to make consistent classifications or predictions over the transferable features. Experiments on an EEG seizure databases demonstrate that the proposed method increases the accuracy over state-of-the-art from 86.83% to 91.71% and specificity from 87.38% to 94.73% while reducing the false positive rate/hour from 0.8/hour to 0.58/hour.

The objective function of the maximum likelihood (ML) method for two-way TOA localization is nonconvex. Thus, the widely-adopted Gauss-Newton iterative method to solve the ML estimator usually suffers from the local minima problem.

Our method is based on a time-frequency concatenation of a Costas sequence with shifted parts of itself. It allows the user to design a low sidelobe region in the range-Doppler domain.

However, most existing methods fail to extract more detailed information and estimate the distant small-scale objects well. In this paper, we propose a monocular depth estimation based on multi-scale feature fusion. Specifically, to obtain input features of different scales, we first feed the input images of different scales to pre-trained residual networks with sharing weights. Then, an attention mechanism is used to learn the salient features at different scales, which can integrate detailed information at large scale feature maps and scene information at small scale feature maps. Furthermore, inspired by the dense atrous spatial pyramid pooling in semantic segmentation, we build a multi-scale feature fusion dense pyramid to further improve the ability of the feature extraction. Last, a scale-invariant error loss is used to predict depth maps in log space. We evaluate our method on several public benchmark datasets (including NYU Depth V2 and KITTI).

We make two main contributions. First, we overcome the main challenges of integrating permutation inversions into an end-to-end training scheme, using recent advances in differentiable ranking. This was heretofore sidestepped by casting the reordering task as classification, fundamentally reducing the space of permutations that can be exploited. Our experiments validate that learning from all possible permutations improves the quality of the pre-trained representations over using a limited, fixed set.

In IS, the samples are simulated from the so-called proposal distribution, and the choice of this proposal is key for achieving a high performance. In adaptive IS (AIS) methods, a set of proposals is iteratively improved. AIS is a relevant and timely methodology although many limitations remain yet to be overcome, e.g., the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional and multi-modal problems. Moreover, the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm has become increasingly popular in machine learning and statistics. HMC has several appealing features such as its exploratory behavior, especially in high-dimensional targets, when other methods suffer.

The proposed HAIS efficiently adapts a population of proposals, extracting the advantages of HMC. HAIS can be understood as a particular instance of the generic layered AIS family with an additional resampling step.

In particular, Gauss-Newton methods are used for nonlinear inverse problems that require iterative updates to be computed from the Jacobian and allow for flexible incorporation of prior knowledge. Computationally more efficient alternatives are Quasi-Newton methods, where the repeated computation of the Jacobian is replaced by an approximate update, but unfortunately are often too restrictive for highly ill-posed problems. To overcome this limitation, we present a highly efficient data-driven Quasi-Newton method applicable to nonlinear inverse problems, by using the singular value decomposition and learning a mapping from model outputs to the singular values to compute the updated Jacobian.

Traditional methods extract hand-crafted features by imitating doctors' experience, while recent methods focus on extracting deep features automatically by designing the architectures of deep neural networks (DNNs). Combining these two kinds of features can not only take advantage of doctors' experience but also mine the hidden information in the raw data. But directly combining these features by fully connected layers may cause complex optimization hyper-planes. To better integrate doctors' experience and deep features that doctors can hardly describe, we propose a feature fusion framework named hybrid plus framework (HPF) and apply this framework to seizure detection.

Existing deep learning based methods have made remarkable progress in NIR-VIS face recognition, while it encounters certain newly-emerged difficulties during the pandemic of COVID-19, since people are supposed to wear facial masks to cut off the spread of the virus. We define this task as NIR-VIS masked face recognition, and find it problematic with the masked face in the NIR probe image. First, the lack of masked face data is a challenging issue for the network training. Second, most of the facial parts (cheeks, mouth, nose etc.) are fully occluded by the mask, which leads to a large amount of loss of information. Third, the domain gap still exists in the remaining facial parts. In such scenario, the existing methods suffer from significant performance degradation caused by the above issues. In this paper, we aim to address the challenge of NIR-VIS masked face recognition from the perspectives of training data and training method. Specifically, we propose a novel heterogeneous training method to maximize the mutual information shared by the face representation of two domains with the help of semi-siamese networks. In addition, a 3D face reconstruction based approach is employed to synthesize masked face from the existing NIR image. Resorting to these practices, our solution provides the domain-invariant face representation which is also robust to the mask occlusion.

Nevertheless, existing methods either use one encoder-decoder to generate results in one step without making good use of structure features which are helpful, or adopt two encoder-decoders to recover structures and textures subsequently where the second encoder-decoder used for recovering textures relies heavily on the first encoder-decoder. Thus, an one-stage method which simultaneously utilizes structures and textures is promising. In this letter, we propose a dual branch encoder-decoder, whose texture branch and edge branch can simultaneously extract features from the masked RGB image and its corresponding edge map.

It is challenging to produce high-quality speech with a low-latency setup that does not make much use of an unobserved future sentence (hereafter, “lookahead”). To resolve this issue, we propose an incremental TTS method that uses a pseudo lookahead generated with a language model to take the future contextual information into account without increasing latency. Our method can be regarded as imitating a human's incremental reading and uses pretrained GPT2, which accounts for the large-scale linguistic knowledge, for the lookahead generation.

In practice, however, a photo can come from an unknown camera model, or its appearance could have been altered by unknown post-processing. In such a case, forensic detectors are prone to fail silently. One way to mitigate silent failures is to use a rejection mechanism for unknown examples. In this work, we propose Gaussian processes (GPs), which intrinsically provide such a rejection mechanism. This makes GPs a potentially powerful tool in multimedia forensics, where forensic analysts regularly work on images from unknown origins. We demonstrate that GPs scale well to the task of camera model identification. Probabilistic predictions from a GP classifier achieve high classification accuracy for known camera models while providing reliable uncertainty estimates. The built-in uncertainty estimates effectively tackle open-set camera model identification, outperforming two state-of-the-art methods.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2021.3070206,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Research and Training Group 2475; Cybercrime and Forensic Computing(grant numbers:#393541319/GRK2475/1-2019); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9392307,Camera model identification;Gaussian processes;open-set classification,Cameras;Training;Support vector machines;Kernel;Data models;Uncertainty;Gaussian processes,,8,,27,IEEE,31 Mar 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end trainable superpixel convolutional network, named SPNet, to learn high-level representation on image superpixel primitives. We start by treating irregular superpixel lattices as a 2D point cloud, where the low-level features inside one superpixel are aggregated to one feature vector.

However, most methods encounter difficulties in detecting unknown attacks in practical use, which often have different statistical distributions from known attacks. Especially, the fast development of synthetic voice spoofing algorithms is generating increasingly powerful attacks, putting the ASV systems at risk of unseen attacks. In this work, we propose an anti-spoofing system to detect unknown synthetic voice spoofing attacks (i.e., text-to-speech or voice conversion) using one-class learning.

In applications where a long adaptive filter is required, the complexity can become prohibitively large due to scarce digital signal processing (DSP) resources such as the available DSP slices on a field programmable gate array (FPGA). Several partial-update least mean square (PU-LMS) algorithms have been proposed to address this problem. Among these algorithms, the sequential PU-LMS alleviates the computational complexity by updating a small subset of adaptive filter coefficients in a round-robin fashion at each iteration. Being data independent, it has no complexity overheads associated with coefficient selection. However, a major problem with the sequential PU-LMS is its vulnerability to poor convergence for cyclostationary input signals encountered in many practical applications. This letter presents a detailed analysis of the convergence issues with the sequential PU-LMS algorithm for cyclostationary white Gaussian input signals. The convergence analysis predicts when poor convergence is likely to occur based on a relationship between partial update and cyclostationary input signal parameters.

Previous studies focus on analyzing aligned sequences, while the unaligned sequential analysis is more practical in real-world scenarios. Due to the long-time dependency hidden in the multimodal unaligned sequence and time alignment information is not provided, exploring the time-dependent interactions within unaligned sequences is more challenging. To this end, we introduce the time squeeze fusion to automatically explore the time-dependent interactions by modeling the unimodal and multimodal sequences from the perspective of compressing the time dimension. Moreover, prior methods tend to fuse unimodal features into a multimodal embedding, based on which sentiment is inferred.

While the SCADA systems introduce many advantages, they also introduce more vulnerabilities by providing opportunities for malicious cyber-attackers. If the cyber-attacks properly modify pressures, flows, and the topology the operator believes is present simultaneously, the cyber-attacks can be undetectable. While this topic has received attention for electrical grids, other cyber-physical systems have seen much less study on this topic. Natural gas networks are employed extensively to power generators in the electrical grid, so attacks on natural gas networks are very important. We have not seen any research on this topic for natural gas networks yet. The particular nonlinear equations which model natural gas networks make the analysis much more difficult. In this paper, we study undetectable attacks on natural gas networks in a signal processing perspective by describing the steady-state mathematical model and sensor measurements. We propose a countermeasure to eliminate undetectable attacks by protecting sensors in specific locations.

Deep Block Transform for Autoencoders,K. H. Jin,"Department of Information and Communication Engineering, DGIST, Daegu, South Korea",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,31 May 2021,2021,28,,1016,1019,"We discover that a trainable convolution layer with a stride over 1 and kernel ≥ stride is identical to a trainable block transform. A block transform is performed when we use a convolution layer with a stride ≥ 2 and a kernel ≥ the stride. For instance, if we use the same widths, such as a 2×2 convolution kernel and stride-2, there are no overlaps between sliding windows, so this layer operates a block transform on the partitioned 2×2 blocks. A block transform reduces the computational complexity due to a stride ≥ 2. To keep the original size, we apply a transposed convolution (stride $=$ kernel ≥ 2), an adjoint operator of a forward block transform. Based on this relationship, we propose a trainable multi-scale block transform for autoencoders. The proposed method has an encoder consisting of two sequential convolutions with stride-2, a 2×2 kernel, and a decoder consisting of the encoder's two adjoint operators (transposed convolution). Clipping is used for nonlinear activations. Inspired by the zero-frequency element in the dictionary learning method, the proposed method uses DC values for residual learning.

Fast Geometric Ensemble (FGE) showed that captured weight points at the end of training time circulate local optima. This led to the Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) approach, which averages multiple model weights to find the local optima. However, they are limited by their output of fully-parameterized models, including needless parameters, after the training procedure. To solve this problem, we propose a novel training procedure: Stochastic Weight Averaging by One-way Variational Pruning (SWA-OVP). SWA-OVP reduces the number of model parameters by variationally updating the mask of weights for pruning. SWA-OVP variationally generates a mask for pruned weights in each iteration while recent pruning approaches produce the mask at the end of each training. In addition, our SWA-OVP prunes the model in a one-way training procedure, while other recent approaches prune the model weights in iterative training or require additional computation. Our experiment shows that SWA-OVP using only a 0.5x% ~ 0.7x% parameter size achieves even higher accuracy than SWA and FGE on several networks, such as Pre-ResNet110, Pre-ResNet164 and WideResNet28x10 on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets.

Small object detection becomes more difficult if the image contains a lot of noise, which is frequent in real environments. The main reason is that the ratio of visual signal to noise on small objects is very low, making it difficult to extract rich features for detection. To address this issue, we propose a feature enhancement network (FEN) that is trained in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, FEN takes features from input images whose values randomly were erased, then predicts the erased values by aggregating neighboring values. This scheme enables FEN to improve features using surrounding values, which have great effects on enriching features from small-object regions during the test phase. To verify the robustness of our method against small object detection from noisy images, we adopt vehicle detection in aerial images as the main target task. The proposed method consistently outperformed the baseline methods in our experiments.

However, most existing networks neglect the feature correlations of adjacent layers, causing features at different levels to not be fully utilized. In this paper, a novel difference value network (DVN) is proposed to address this problem. The proposed network makes full use of different levels of features by using the difference values (D-values) of adjacent layers. Specifically, a difference value block (DVB) is designed to extract the difference values of adjacent layers. The extracted difference value can highlight which regions should be paid more attention to, so as to guide image SR. Further, a difference value group (DVG) is designed to integrate the difference values extracted by the difference value block into its output.

Existing selection-channel-aware CNN-based steganalyzers usually incorporate the embedding probability into the first convolutional layer.

The zero LS error is an evident mark to judge the number of sources, especially for the scenario of the unknown noise variances.

Examples of Point Cloud (PC) applications range from 3D representations of small objects up to large scenes, both still or dynamic in time. PC adoption triggered the development of new coding, transmission, and display methodologies that culminated in new international standards for PC compression. Along with these, in the last couple of years, novel methods have been developed for evaluating the visual quality of PC contents. This paper presents a new objective full-reference visual quality assessment metric for static PC contents, named BitDance, which uses color and geometry texture descriptors. The proposed method first extracts the statistics of color and geometry information of the reference and test PCs.

Existing methods mainly rely on learned external cues like pose or parsing to ease occlusion distraction. This knowledge highly related to body semantics may introduce alignment effects, leading to additional requirements for dedicated training data and inference computation. We propose the Self-guided Body Part Alignment method that learns cue-free semantic-aligned local prediction for feature representations to avoid high-cost dependence on external cues. First, scale-wise global spatial attention is utilized to determine essential body parts automatically. A relation transformer network is then employed to predict semantic-aligned local parts, guided with anchored global information by constraint loss. Similarity metrics for all parts are merged with threshold conditions to filter invisible body parts comprehensively. Experimental results on occluded and holistic person reID benchmarks show the proposed method outperforms other cue-relied and cue-free methods.

Most channel pruning methods often use a fixed compression rate for all the layers of the model, which, however, may not be optimal. To address this issue, given a specific target compression rate, one can search for the optimal compression rate for each layer via some automated methods. Nevertheless, when we consider multiple compression rates, these methods have to repeat the channel pruning process multiple times, once for each rate, which can be unnecessary and inefficient. To tackle the problem, we propose a Conditional Automated Channel Pruning (CACP) method which simultaneously produces compressed models under different compression rates through a single channel pruning process. Specifically, CACP takes a set of compression rates and the original model as its input, and outputs the feasible compressed models that satisfy the considered compression rates. To learn CACP, we cast the layer-by-layer channel pruning process into a Markov decision process (MDP), in which we seek to solve a series of decision-making problems. Based on MDP, we develop a reinforcement learning (RL) framework with deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to learn the optimal policy. To satisfy the constraint items in the optimization problem, we design a constraint-guaranteed method, which guides the agent to search for compressed models that satisfy the computational constraints by limiting the action space.

This task is quite challenging and has not been fully studied to date. Current works mainly focus on body shape or contour sketch, but they are not robust enough due to view and posture variations. The key to this task is to exploit cloth-irrelevant cues. This paper proposes a semantic-guided pixel sampling approach for the cloth-changing person re-ID task. We do not explicitly define which feature to extract but force the model to automatically learn cloth-irrelevant cues. Specifically, we firstly recognize the pedestrian's upper clothes and pants, then randomly change them by sampling pixels from other pedestrians. The changed samples retain the identity labels but exchange the pixels of clothes or pants among different pedestrians. Besides, we adopt a loss function to constrain the learned features to keep consistent before and after changes. In this way, the model is forced to learn cues that are irrelevant to upper clothes and pants. We conduct extensive experiments on the latest released PRCC dataset.

However, considering the slight inter-class variations and significant intra-class variations, pseudo-identity-labels learned from clustering algorithms are usually noisy and coarse. To alleviate the problems above, besides clustering pseudo-identity-labels, we propose to learn pseudo-patch-labels, which brings two advantages: (1) Patch naturally alleviates the effect of backgrounds, occlusions, and carryings since they usually occupy small parts in images, thus overcome noisy labels. (2) It is plausible that patches from different pedestrians belong to the same pseudo-identity-label.

By utilizing a gating mechanism as the binary classifier, gating methods can decompose GZSL into a conventional ZSL problem and a supervision learning task, thereby leading to outstanding performance by GZSL. However, unseen classes contain many confusing visual samples that distribute too close to the seen class boundaries and are prone to misclassification. To solve this problem, we propose a novel semantic encoding out-of-distribution classifier (SE-OOD) for GZSL. Our method first utilizes semantically consistent mapping to project all the visual samples to their corresponding semantic attributes.

However, the cover source mismatch (CSM) problem, which can be attributed to the discrepancy between the training, and evaluation datasets, is still one of the pivotal obstacles for adapting the steganalysis into real-world applications. In this letter, we propose to merge the domain adaptation strategy into CNN-based audio steganalysis for handling the CSM problem. Specifically, the proposed framework contains three components: feature extractor, steganalytic classifier, and domain discriminator.

The performance of the proposed method was extensively tested in experiments simulating multi-target tracking on unit hyperspheres, where we compared our approach to the von Mises-Fisher and the Kalman filters in the embedding space that projects the estimated state back to the manifold. Obtained results show that the proposed method outperforms the competitive trackers in the optimal sub-pattern assignment metric for all the tested hypersphere dimensions. Although our use case geometry is that of a unit hypersphere, our approach is by no means limited to it and can be applied to any Riemannian manifold with closed-form expressions for exponential/logarithmic maps and parallel transport along the geodesic curve.

In this letter, we propose a new robust incremental weighted Fourier aggregation algorithm for dynamic scene video deblurring. This is motivated by the fact that existing multiframe aggregation methods usually require a tedious iterative process to obtain sharp information in distant frames. We propose to perform alignment and aggregation once for each frame using the current frame and the previous frame result, which includes the sharp information of all the previous frames. Moreover, a criterion for evaluating the alignment of blurred images is proposed. Based on this, a robust aggregation approach is also proposed to help reduce artifacts caused by image patch alignment failure. Specifically, we decompose the current frame into a series of image patches, find consistent image patches in the deblurring results of the previous frame by a coarse-to-fine alignment algorithm, and aggregate them in the Fourier domain. Experiments show that our method can obtain improved deblurring results and reduce the computational complexity compared to the traditional aggregation method.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2021.3097239,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872019,61972015); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9484715,Video deblurring;Fourier aggregation;camera shake;motion blur;lucky region,Smoothing methods;Signal processing algorithms;Aggregates;Training;Kernel;Computational complexity;Pipelines,,3,,20,IEEE,14 Jul 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

The leading counting approaches focus on single-category counting tasks and achieve impressive performance. Nevertheless, there are multiple categories of objects in real scenes. Multi-class object counting expands the scope of application of object counting tasks. The multi-target detection task can achieve multi-class object counting in some scenarios. However, it requires the dataset annotated with bounding boxes. Compared with the point-level annotations used in mainstream object counting issues, the box-level annotations are more difficult to be obtained. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient counting network based on point-level annotations. Specifically, we first change the traditional estimated density map from one to the number of categories to achieve multi-class object counting. Since all categories of objects use the same feature extractor, their features will interfere mutually in the shared feature space. We further design a multi-mask structure to suppress the negative interaction among objects.

To mitigate this WPE drawback, we recently developed an offline dereverberation method called switching WPE (SwWPE), which has multiple MCLP filters and switches them for each time-frequency bin. We here propose a recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm for the online optimization of SwWPE.

Provable Super-Convergence With a Large Cyclical Learning Rate,S. Oymak,"Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Riverside, Riverside, CA, USA",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,26 Aug 2021,2021,28,,1645,1649,"Conventional wisdom dictates that learning rate should be in the stable regime so that gradient-based algorithms don't blow up. This letter introduces a simple scenario where an unstably large learning rate scheme leads to a super fast convergence, with the convergence rate depending only logarithmically on the condition number of the problem. Our scheme uses a Cyclical Learning Rate where we periodically take one large unstable step and several small stable steps to compensate for the instability. These findings also help explain the empirical observations of [Smith and Topin, 2019] where they show that CLR with a large maximum learning rate can dramatically accelerate learning and lead to so-called “super-convergence”. We prove that our scheme excels in the problems where Hessian exhibits a bimodal spectrum and the eigenvalues can be grouped into two clusters (small and large). The unstably large step is the key to enabling fast convergence over the small eigen-spectrum.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2021.3101131,"NSF; CNS(grant numbers:1 932 254); CAREER Award(grant numbers:2046816); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9502521,Convergence of numerical methods;Iterative algorithms;Gradient methods,Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Convergence;Jacobian matrices;Standards;Deep learning;Signal processing algorithms;Schedules,,2,,25,IEEE,30 Jul 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals
Learning to Balance the Learning Rates Between Various Modalities via Adaptive Tracking Factor,Y. Sun; S. Mai; H.

In our experiment, however, we observe that this is not always the case. Prior efforts on multimodal tasks mainly tend to design a uniform optimization algorithm for all modalities, and yet only obtain a sub-optimal multimodal representation with the fusion of under-optimized unimodal representations, which are still challenged by performance drop on multimodal networks caused by heterogeneity among modalities. In this work, to remove the slowdowns in performance on multimodal tasks, we decouple the learning procedures of unimodal and multimodal networks by dynamically balancing the learning rates for various modalities, so that the modality-specific optimization algorithm for each modality can be obtained. Specifically, the adaptive tracking factor (ATF) is introduced to adjust the learning rate for each modality on a real-time basis. Furthermore, adaptive convergent equalization (ACE) and bilevel directional optimization (BDO) are proposed to equalize and update the ATF, avoiding sub-optimal unimodal representations due to overfitting or underfitting.

However, further improving the detection performance on challenging scenes (e.g., low-light scenes) requires additional investigation. Thermal infrared imaging captures thermal radiation from the surface of objects. Thus, it is insensitive to lighting conditions and can provide uniform imaging of objects. Accordingly, we propose a two-stage fusion network (TSFNet) integrating RGB and thermal information for RGB-T SOD. For the first fusion stage, we propose a feature-wise fusion module that captures and aggregates united information and intersecting information in each local region of the RGB and thermal images, and then independent decoding is applied to the RGB and thermal features. For the second fusion stage, we propose a bilateral auxiliary fusion module that extracts auxiliary spatial features from the foreground and background of the thermal and RGB modalities. Finally, we use multiple supervision to further improve the SOD performance.

A classical statistical approach to BSS is to fit a linear generative model that consists of spatial and source models representing the inter-channel covariances and power spectral densities of sources, respectively. Although the variational autoencoder (VAE) has successfully been used as a non-linear source model with latent features, it should be pretrained from a sufficient amount of isolated signals. Our method, in contrast, enables the VAE-based source model to be trained only from mixture signals. Specifically, we introduce a neural mixture-to-feature inference model that directly infers the latent features from the observed mixture and integrate it with a neural feature-to-mixture generative model consisting of a full-rank spatial model and a VAE-based source model. All the models are optimized jointly such that the likelihood for the training mixtures is maximized in the framework of AVI. Once the inference model is optimized, it can be used for estimating the latent features of sources included in unseen mixture signals.

Moreover, few methods are available to deal with scenarios where the system dimensionality may be either low or high. To overcome these drawbacks, this letter develops two new methods to compute the threshold for a given nominal false alarm probability (FAP), without any assumptions on the sample size and system dimensionality. Specifically, the exact result of FAP in terms of MeijerG function is established, which enables us to accurately determine the threshold through numerical solution.

While novel methods address this problem, they rely on modified feature extractors and thus necessitate retraining. We instead propose a method that can be applied on a pretrained classifier. Our method exploits a fidelity map estimate that is fused into the internal representations of the feature extractor, thereby guiding the attention of the network and making it more robust to noisy data.

Based on this analysis, the whole embedding operation is decomposed into three independent tasks that target three vertex coordinate components, respectively. To obtain vertex-changing probabilities, we construct a payload-limited sender (PLS) problem aimed at minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the cover and stego mesh distributions for a given payload. Next, vertex coordinates are quantified so that the PLS problem can be solved in practice. Finally, a ternary embedding scheme is taken as a typical steganographic case.

Existing related methods mainly focus on independently leveraging the spatial information of individual filters while ignoring the inner correlation among filters. In this letter, we propose a dual rank-constrained filter pruning approach for convolutional neural networks, in which the representation, clustering, and identification of representative filters are integrated into an adaptive graph regularization framework. Particularly, the proposed approach utilizes the low-rank constraint to capture the low-dimensional intrinsic representations of filters for the adaptive affinity graph construction and clustering. It is noteworthy that the original filters are projected as points on Grassmann manifold for geometrical structure preserving. Meanwhile, the high-rank constraint is employed to select the most informative filter for representing the cluster.

Relying on the powerful capability of some pre-trained networks, various models can extract diverse deep features. However, they are unaware of the problem of feature selection and reweighting when predicting saliency. This situation gives rise to features describing scene distractors potentially also contributing to the saliency maps. In this paper, we propose a feature selection and reweighting module (FSRM) for deep saliency prediction models. Through the FSRM, we wish to highlight the saliency-related features in a manner similar to channel attention and simultaneously exclude distractor features by reducing the channel number of deep features. Specifically, in the FSRM, we obtain an importance descriptor of feature channels, where some saliency knowledge including the center prior and rarity is encoded. Furthermore, the number of feature channels is reduced via a transformation matrix derived from the importance descriptor. To predict the saliency, the FSRM is embedded in a hierarchical fusion network that makes use of multi-level features.

However they often ignore the modality-specific and modality-shared local feature matching. Modality-specific local matching could help extract discriminative identity-consistent features and alleviate spatial misalignment, and modality-shared local matching could make identity-consistent features be correlated in two modalities and mitigate the modality misalignment. Therefore, we establish the intra-modality and inter-modality co-occurrence relation between identity parts. We observe the modality-specific and modality-shared local feature matching of identity parts as intra-modality and inter-modality low-rank relation-finding problems.

The natural image statistics (NIS) can not only reflect certain response characteristics of the visual system, but also provide accurate quantitative descriptions of the HVS. Inspired by this fact, a visual model, which is named as visual neuron matrix (VNM), is built by a statistical learning process on natural image samples. On the basis of the VNM, a blind image quality assessment (BIQA) model is proposed.

In this letter, we extend the state-of-the-art single-tone time-frequency (TF) domain ENF detector to the multi-tone scenario and propose a multi-harmonic combining (MHC) method, exploiting ENF harmonic components for improved detection performance. To exclude the corrupted components interfering rather than contributing to ENF detection, the proposed detector first performs a pre-screening based on the estimated average subband signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) to exclude interfering components. Then, with the selected harmonic candidates, a second screening process is applied based on the TF test statistics (TSs), i.e., the variances of observed subband traces. After that, the multi-harmonic components are combined to form the final TS, whose sign determines the final decision.

To alleviate this issue, we propose a Neural Architecture Search (NAS)-based deep learning network to realize the IVIF task, which can automatically discover the modality-oriented feature representation.

The MSRN consists of a number of multi-scale residual blocks (MSRBs), and each MSRB performs convolutions by exploiting two different sizes of windows for conducting multi-scale feature extraction. The smaller window is used to extract image features at a low scale, while the larger one is used for a high scale. To significantly reduce the number of parameters involved in the MSRB, a new feature extraction module, called the asynchronous multi-scale block (AMB), is proposed in this paper. It is based on the fact that the larger window used in the MSRB can be replaced by two smaller windows without affecting the original MSRB's function. Consequently, by replacing each MSRB with our AMB, an asynchronous multi-scale network (AMNet) is then constructed, which can yield a significant reduction on computational complexity. This means that more AMBs can be used in our AMNet to deliver superior SISR performance, while maintaining the same or comparable computational complexity to that of the MSRN. To consolidate all image features generated from all scales, a new fusion scheme, called the adaptive feature fusion block (AFFB), is proposed that weights the extracted features according to their importance for further increasing SISR's performance.

In this letter, we present an anti-collusion mechanism that has a higher embedding capacity and can significantly degrade the perceptual quality of the colluded files regardless of the number of colluders. In the proposed mechanism, we first segment the host audio file into frames and perform the discrete cosine transform (DCT) on each frame. Then multiple fingerprint bits are embedded into each frame by reversing the DCT coefficients of the corresponding frequency band. As a result, when a collusion attack occurs, our proposed embedding mechanism can introduce perceptibly annoying differences between frames in the colluded file, which leads to severe perceptual quality degradation.

Temporal Envelope and Fine Structure Cues for Dysarthric Speech Detection Using CNNs,I. Kodrasi,"Idiap Research Institute, Martigny, Switzerland",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,24 Sep 2021,2021,28,,1853,1857,"Deep learning-based techniques for automatic dysarthric speech detection have recently attracted interest in the research community. State-of-the-art techniques typically learn neurotypical and dysarthric discriminative representations by processing time-frequency input representations such as the magnitude spectrum of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Although these techniques are expected to leverage perceptual dysarthric cues, representations such as the magnitude spectrum of the STFT do not necessarily convey perceptual aspects of complex sounds. Inspired by the temporal processing mechanisms of the human auditory system, in this letter we factor signals into the product of a slowly varying envelope and a rapidly varying fine structure. Separately exploiting the different perceptual cues present in the envelope (i.e., phonetic information, stress, and voicing) and fine structure (i.e., pitch, vowel quality, and breathiness), two discriminative representations are learned through a convolutional neural network and used for automatic dysarthric speech detection.

Among the algorithms derived from the framework, the ISTA-based (PnP-ISTA) has attracted much attentions due to the effectiveness and simple update rule in iterations. And its convergence analysis has become a fundamental topic. Most recently, the theoretical convergence of PnP-ISTA with kernel denoisers has been established, where the kernel is generic (relaxing the reliance on special properties) and thus beneficial for wider applications. In there, the convergence proof focuses on fixed kernels. Note that, the denoisers with adaptive kernels usually achieve more powerful performance than those with fixed ones. Inspired by the preliminary observation, we extend the fixed kernels to adaptive ones for the denoisers in PnP-ISTA. Under a mild assumption, we prove the convergence theoretically.

In this work, we propose an MTL network with a deep joint source-channel coding (JSCC) framework, which allows operating under CI scenarios. We first propose a feature fusion based MTL network (FFMNet) for joint object detection and semantic segmentation. Compared with other MTL networks, FFMNet gets higher performance with fewer parameters. Then FFMNet is split into two parts, which run on a mobile device and an edge server respectively. The feature generated by the mobile device is transmitted through the wireless channel to the edge server. To reduce the transmission overhead of the intermediate feature, a deep JSCC network is designed. By combining two networks together, the whole model achieves 512× compression for the intermediate feature and a performance loss within 2% on both tasks. At last, by training with noise, the FFMNet with JSCC is robust to various channel conditions and outperforms the separate source and channel coding scheme.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2021.3113827,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972115,61872116); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9541059,Collaborative intelligence;multi-task learning;deep joint source-channel coding,Feature extraction;Task analysis;Servers;Semantics;Object detection;Training;Mobile handsets,,25,,24,IEEE,20 Sep 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

In view of the deficiency of PULSE, in this letter we incorporate a conditional constraint to its unsupervised pixel recovery process. Specifically, we embed a PULSE generator within the Laplacian pyramid framework and install a corresponding pre-trained conditional adversarial net (CGAN) at each pyramid level to predict the difference between the reconstructed SR image obtained by PULSE and the ground truth. The difference is added to the reconstructed SR image at each level to obtain a new SR image that is closer to the ground truth, such a process is repeated across the subsequent levels until a full-resolution version is yielded.

Chaotic sensing is one such methodology that employs deterministic, fractal sampling in conjunction with finite, iterative reconstruction schemes to form an image from limited samples. Using a sampling pattern constructed entirely from periodic lines in DFT space, chaotic sensing was found to outperform traditional compressed sensing for magnetic resonance imaging; however, only one such sampling pattern was presented and the reason for its fractal nature was not proven. Through the introduction of a novel image transform known as the kaleidoscope transform, which formalises and extends upon the concept of downsampling and concatenating an image with itself, this letter: (1) demonstrates a fundamental relationship between multiplication in modular arithmetic and downsampling; (2) provides a rigorous mathematical explanation for the fractal nature of the sampling pattern in the DFT; and (3) leverages this understanding to develop a collection of novel fractal sampling patterns for the 2D DFT with customisable properties. The ability to design tailor-made fractal sampling patterns expands the utility of the DFT in chaotic imaging and may form the basis for a bespoke chaotic sensing methodology, in which the fractal sampling matches the imaging task for improved reconstruction.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2021.3116510,"National Health and Medical Research Council(grant numbers:APP113986); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552454,Chaotic sensing;fractals;kaleidoscope transform;sparse image reconstruction,Fractals;Magnetic resonance imaging;Discrete Fourier transforms;Chaos;Transforms;Sensors;Image reconstruction,,2,,19,IEEE,29 Sep 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Next, the focusing process generates a spatial-level representation for each frame individually by an attention module. This representation is regarded as a supernode to aggregate the feature from each joint node in each frame for spatial context extraction. After generating supernodes for the entire sequence, a transformer encoder layer is proposed to capture the temporal context further.

Multi-switch antenna selection results in a data matrix with missing entries, a scenario for which existing order estimation methods that build on the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix do not perform well. A direct application of the Davis-Kahan theorem allows us to show that the signal subspace is quite robust in the presence of missing entries. Based on this finding, this letter proposes a matrix completion (MC) subspace-based order estimation criterion that exploits the shift-invariance property of ULAs. A recently proposed shift-invariant matrix completion (SIMC) method is used for reconstructing the data matrix, and the proposed order estimation criterion is based on the chordal subspace distance between two submatrices extracted from the reconstructed matrix for increasing values of the dimension of the signal subspace.

Domain Discrepancy Elimination and Mean Face Representation Learning for NIR-VIS Face Recognition,W. Hu; H. Hu,"School of Electronics and Information Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China; School of Electronics and Information Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,29 Oct 2021,2021,28,,2068,2072,"Due to its potential application in criminal cases, security systems and multimedia information retrieval, Near InfraRed (NIR) to VISible (VIS) face recognition has attracted increasing research attention in the field of computer vision. However, it is still a challenging task because of the large intra-class variations including spectrum, occlusion, lighting, blurry, expression and pose. To address the above problem, we propose a novel Domain discrepancy Elimination and Mean face Representation learning (DEMR) for NIR-VIS face recognition. The DEMR consists of two key components comprising Class-wise Domain Discrepancy Elimination (CDDE) and Cross-modal Mean Face Alignment (CMFA). Specifically, two-branch modality-specific networks are designed to extract features for VIS images and NIR images, respectively. Considering that distribution variations of cross-modal images will decrease recognition performance, we present CDDE to eliminate modality gap by narrowing distribution differences of VIS images and NIR images in a category-by-category manner. Moreover, to reduce the intra-class discrepancies and obtain compact feature representation, the CMFA is designed to achieve representation alignment between cross-domain images and VIS prototypes (i.e., VIS mean face representations), through optimizing a quadruplet constraint. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging NIR-VIS databases validate that our DEMR is effective for cross-modal face recognition task.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2021.3116861,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62076262,61673402,61273270,60802069); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9555374,NIR-VIS face recognition;cross-modal face alignment;domain discrepancy elimination,Face recognition;Prototypes;Feature extraction;Faces;Task analysis;Lighting,,5,,50,IEEE,30 Sep 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

While many such networks can upscalelow-resolution (LR) images using just the raw pixel-level information, the ill-posed nature of SR can make it difficult to accurately super-resolve an image which has undergone multiple different degradations. Additional information (metadata) describing the degradation process (such as the blur kernel applied, compression level, etc.) can guide networks to super-resolve LR images with higher fidelity to the original source. Previous attempts at informing SR networks with degradation parameters have indeed been able to improve performance in a number of scenarios. However, due to the fully-convolutional nature of many SR networks, most of these metadata fusion methods either require a complete architectural change, or necessitate the addition of significant extra complexity. Thus, these approaches are difficult to introduce into arbitrary SR networks without considerable design alterations. In this letter, we introduce meta-attention, a simple mechanism which allows any SR CNN to exploit the information available in relevant degradation parameters. The mechanism functions by translating the metadata into a channel attention vector, which in turn selectively modulates the network's feature maps. Incorporating meta-attention into SR networks is straightforward, as it requires no specific type of architecture to function correctly. Extensive testing has shown that meta-attention can consistently improve the pixel-level accuracy of state-of-the-art (SOTA) networks when provided with relevant degradation metadata. Despite average memory/runtime overheads of less than $\approx$2.6%/0.025 seconds for the datasets and models considered, meta-attention improves the performance for both PSNR and SSIM; for PSNR, the gain onblurred/downsampled (×4) images is of 0.2969 dB (on average) and 0.3320 dB for SOTA general and face SR models, respectively.

Robust Dynamic Multi-Modal Data Fusion: A Model Uncertainty Perspective,B. Liu,"Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,2 Nov 2021,2021,28,,2107,2111,"This letter is concerned with multi-modal data fusion (MMDF) under unexpected modality failures in nonlinear non-Gaussian dynamic processes. An efficient framework to tackle this problem is proposed. In particular, a notion termed modality “usefulness,” which takes a value of 1 or 0, is used for indicating whether the observation of this modality is useful or not. For $n$ modalities involved, $2^n$ combinations of their “usefulness” values exist. Each combination defines one hypothetical model of the true data generative process. Then the problem of concern is formalized as a task of nonlinear non-Gaussian state filtering under model uncertainty, which is addressed by a dynamic model averaging (DMA) based particle filter (PF) algorithm. This DMA algorithm employs $2^n$ models, while all models share the same state-transition function and a unique set of particle values. That makes its computational complexity only slightly larger than a single model based PF algorithm, especially for scenarios in which $n$ is small.

To tackle the above shortcomings, we propose a Dual Alignment Self-supervised Incomplete Multi-view Subspace Clustering network (DASIMSC) in this paper. Specifically, the manifold alignment constraint and consistency alignment constraint are integrated with the autoencoder to preserve the compact inherent local structure within the view and the consistency semantics between incomplete views, respectively.

Previous work treated it as a regression problem by giving different scores on normal and anomaly events. However, the widely used mini-batch training strategy may suffer from the data imbalance between these two types of events, which limits the model's performance. In this work, a cross-epoch learning (XEL) strategy associated with a hard instance bank (HIB) is proposed to introduce additional information from previous training epochs. Two new losses are proposed for XEL to achieve a higher detection rate as well as a lower false alarm rate of anomaly events. Moreover, the proposed XEL can be directly integrated into any existing WSAD framework.

Meanwhile, a deep convolutional neural network is employed to self-supervisedly capture the deep prior of the clean video without any training data. Our method organically integrates hand-crated priors and self-supervised deep priors to achieve both high generalization abilities and representation abilities.

The diverse quality degradations not only dissatisfy the user expectation but also lead to a significant performance drop in many underwater vision applications. This letter proposes a novel two-branch deep neural network for underwater image enhancement (UIE), which is capable of separately removing color cast and enhancing image contrast by fully leveraging useful properties of the HSV color space in disentangling chrominance and intensity. Specifically, the input underwater image is first converted into the HSV color space and disentangled into HS and V channels to serve as the input of the two branches, respectively. Then, the color cast removal branch enhances the H and S channels with a generative adversarial network architecture while the contrast enhancement branch enhances the V channel via a traditional convolutional neural network. The enhanced channels by the two branches are merged and converted back into RGB color space to obtain the final enhanced result.

To solve this problem, we propose a novel method named adaptive flexible optimal graph (AFOG) for unsupervised dimensionality reduction.

Improving the Visual Quality of Video Frame Prediction Models Using the Perceptual Straightening Hypothesis,P. Kancharla; S. S.

A recent neuroscience study hypothesizes that the perceptual representations of a sequence of frames extracted from a natural video follow a straight temporal trajectory. The perceptual representations of a sequence of video frames are found using a computational model of the LGN and V1 areas of the human visual system. In this work, we leverage the strength of this perceptual straightening model to formulate a novel objective function for video frame prediction. In general, a frame prediction model takes past frames as input and predicts the future frame. We enforce the perceptual straightness constraint through adversarial training by introducing the proposed novel quality aware discriminator loss. Our quality aware discriminator imposes the linear relationship between the perceptual representation of the predicted frame and the perceptual representations of the past frames.Specifically, we claim that imposing a perceptual straightness constraint through the discriminator helps in predicting (i.e., generating) video frames that look more natural and therefore, having a higher perceptual quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed objective function on two popular video datasets using three different frame prediction models. These experiments show that our solution is both consistent and stable, thereby allowing it to be integrated with other frame prediction models as well.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2021.3118639,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9565336,Image generation;video generation;video prediction,Predictive models;Computational modeling;Training data;Feature extraction;Visualization;Trajectory;Image generation,,3,,24,IEEE,8 Oct 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

However, with only a few snapshots, these techniques incur large estimation error, which saturates away from zero even as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) tends to infinity. We address this issue by moving away from estimating the coarray covariance matrix when snapshots are limited, and instead proposing a “proxy covariance matrix” (Prox-Cov) that provides an alternate estimate of the coarray subspace (but does not attempt to estimate the source powers). (Prox-Cov) is shown to outperform coarray MUSIC with limited snapshots when the number of sources exceeds the number of sensors. Moreover, when the number of sources is fewer than sensors, we prove that (Prox-Cov) leads to exact identification of the coarray subspace with very few snapshots in the absence of noise, while the error of coarray MUSIC provably saturates in this regime.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2021.3120939,"Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-19-1-2256,N00014-19-1-2227); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1700506); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9580685,Sparse arrays;nested sampling;super-resolution;toeplitz covariance estimation;direction-of-arrival estimation,Multiple signal classification;Covariance matrices;Sensor arrays;Signal to noise ratio;Signal processing algorithms;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Direction-of-arrival estimation,,9,,31,IEEE,19 Oct 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals
