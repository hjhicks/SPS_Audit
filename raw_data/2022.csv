However, most methods can only reenact a particular person once trained or suffer from the low-quality generation of the target images.

However, these methods are usually troubled by the boundary effect. Besides, the violent environment variations severely confuse trackers that neglect temporal environmental changes among consecutive frames, leading to unwanted tracking drift. In this letter, we propose a novel DCF-based tracking method to promote the insensitivity of the tracker under uncertain environmental changes. Specifically, a regularization term is proposed to learn the environment residual between two adjacent frames, which can enhance the discrimination and insensitivity of the filter in fickle tracking scenarios. Further, we design an efficient strategy to acquire the environment information based on the current observation without additional computation.

Each of the two sub-systems can measure the target echoes. The problem is to determine the locations of multiple targets in the surrounding area. A conventional approach is to directly estimate the target locations from the joint distribution of the mono- and bi-static observations, which is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a efficient two-step method that first uses the delay and angle estimates from each individual system to determine initial target locations, which are subsequently refined via an association and fusion step. Specifically, we use a 2-dimensional (2-D) fast Fourier transform (FFT) based approach to obtain the delay and angle estimates of each target in a sequential manner. The delay/angle estimates obtained by mono-static and bi-static systems lead to two sets of initial target location estimates, which are then sorted and paired via a minimum distance criterion. Finally, the initial location estimates are fused/weighted according to the target strength observed by each system. Simulation results show that our cooperative approach yields significant improved performance over non-cooperative approaches using only the mono-static or bi-static sensing system.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2021.3121626","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-1923739); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9583869","Mono-static sensing;bi-static sensing;multiple targets localization;delay and angle estimation;2-D FFT","Sensors;Delays;Location awareness;Radar;Receiving antennas;Automotive engineering;Radar signal processing","","15","","22","IEEE","21 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

(2) Part attention module helps learning discriminative part features of objects.

In such cases, the widely used matched filter (MF) cannot perfectly separate the waveforms, and it outputs the filtered echo of the desired waveform (auto term) as well as multiple undesired waveform residuals (cross terms). In this paper, a transmit delay compensation scheme is proposed by employing a set of transmit delay compensation variables to control the cross terms so that they can be utilized to enhance target detection. Specifically, the probability of detection is maximized by optimizing the delay parameters. To solve the resulting nonconvex problem, an optimum solution based on multi-dimensional search and a computationally efficient suboptimal method are proposed.

To tackle this problem, we propose an individually trained synthetic-to-real domain adaptation (SDA) network that maps synthetic images into the real domain. Specifically, our approach translates the data style from synthetic domain to real domain while maintaining the content and the spatial information. First, edge cues are leveraged to guide domain adaptation in preserving the spatial consistency between input and the generated image.

However, its performance is determined by a penalty factor, which is normally chosen by trial and error. Hence, this work proposes an optimal penalty factor and its feasible estimation that does not require any assumptions of Gaussian reference signal or input independence.

In data-scarce or low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes, learned templates overfit the data and lack smoothness, which can affect the predictive performance of downstream tasks. To address this limitation, we propose GPCDL, a convolutional dictionary learning framework that enforces priors on templates using Gaussian Processes (GPs). With the focus on smoothness, we show theoretically that imposing a GP prior is equivalent to Wiener filtering the learned templates, thereby suppressing high-frequency components and promoting smoothness. We show that the algorithm is a simple extension of the classical iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm, independent of the choice of GP kernels. This property allows one to experiment flexibly with different smoothness assumptions. Through simulation, we show that GPCDL learns smooth dictionaries with better accuracy than the unregularized alternative across a range of SNRs. Through an application to neural spiking data, we show that GPCDL learns a more accurate and visually-interpretable smooth dictionary, leading to superior predictive performance compared to non-regularized CDL, as well as parametric alternatives.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2021.3127471","Samsung; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9612002","Convolutional dictionary learning;Gaussian process;exponential family;Wiener filter;smoothness","Dictionaries;Kernel;Convolution;Signal to noise ratio;Machine learning;Gaussian processes;Signal processing algorithms","","2","","28","IEEE","11 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two-way TOA measurements between AN-UD pairs are obtained via round-trip communications to achieve localization and synchronization (LAS) for a UD. Existing LAS method for a moving UD with clock drift adopts an iterative algorithm, which requires accurate initialization and has high computational complexity. In this letter, we propose a new closed-form two-way TOA LAS approach, namely CFTWLAS, which does not require initialization, has low complexity and empirically achieves optimal LAS accuracy. We first linearize the LAS problem by squaring and differencing the two-way TOA equations. We employ two auxiliary variables to simplify the problem to finding the analytical solution of quadratic equations. Due to the measurement noise, we can only obtain a raw LAS estimation from the solution of the auxiliary variables. Then, a weighted least squares step is applied to further refine the raw estimation. We analyze the theoretical error of the new CFTWLAS and show that it empirically reaches the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) with sufficient ANs under the condition of proper geometry and small noise. Numerical results in a 3D scenario verify the theoretical analysis that the estimation accuracy of the new CFTWLAS method reaches CRLB in the presented experiments when the number of ANs is large, the geometry is appropriate, and the noise is small.

However, there are still two issues that need to be ameliorated. First, the prevailing linguistic steganalysis methods rely heavily on massive training data, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Second, these methods implement steganalysis only in different weak-concealed scenarios, the stego texts in each of which have only a single language style and payload. But in practice, the intercepted network samples are probably the mixture of the stego texts that possess different language styles and payloads, in which the semantic spatial distribution may be more chaotic than that in weak-concealed scenarios, thus making steganalysis more difficult. To address the above issues, a novel linguistic steganalysis method is proposed in this letter. First, the pre-trained BERT language model is constructed as an embedder to compensate for the shortage of data. Then, in addition to learning local and global semantic features, a feature interaction module is designed for exploring mutual effects between them. Furthermore, besides the typical cross-entropy loss, triplet loss is also introduced for the model training. In this way, the proposed method can refine more comprehensive and discriminative deep features in the intricate semantic space. The performance of the proposed method is compared with the representative linguistic steganalysis methods on datasets of different scales, and the experimental results reveal the superiority of the proposed method.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2021.3128372","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9616404","Linguistic steganalysis;neural networks;small-scale concealed scenarios;feature interaction","Feature extraction;Linguistics;Semantics;Training;Payloads;Steganography;Neural networks","","12","","31","IEEE","16 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose an Across-scale Progressive Attention Network (i.e., APAN) to explore the multi-scale collaborative representation for single image deraining. Specifically, we represent each rainy image via a multi-scale module. An across-scale attention module is then used to capture long-range feature correspondences from multi-scale features, which can model the rain streaks at an enlarging feature dimension.

However, the JPEG recompression of social networks changes the DCT coefficients of stego images, resulting in the failure of adaptive steganography. To achieve steganography in lossy channels, robust steganography has been proposed. In this letter, the ability against JPEG recompression of robust steganography is further improved by introducing a robustness cost function. For calculating the robustness cost, a robustness model based on the spatial domain calculated from DCT coefficients is firstly proposed. Then the robustness cost is acquired by measuring the distance between the spatial pixels calculated from modified DCT coefficients and the robustness model adjusted spatial pixels. Combining the distortion function and the robustness cost function, the method proposed has considerable robustness performance while maintaining satisfying security performance. Experimental results show that with the maximum reduction of 4.04% on security performance, the algorithm proposed has a significant improvement on robustness performance compared with state-of-the-art robust steganography.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2021.3129419","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1736214,61972390,61802393,61872356,61902391); National Key Technology Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2019QY0701); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9622143","Robust steganography;JPEG steganography;JPEG recompression","Robustness;Discrete cosine transforms;Transform coding;Steganography;Costs;Distortion;Social networking (online)","","21","","15","IEEE","19 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While deep neural networks are becoming popular for automatic sleep stage classification with supervised learning, large-scale labeled datasets are still hard to acquire.

However, existing SSL methods are mainly designed for non-temporally correlated data and only learning representations from an instance level. Hence, the objective of this paper is to learn robust and generalizable representations for physiological signals with self-supervised learning. Specifically, we make the following contributions: (1) we propose a novel co-training scheme by exploiting complementary information from multiple views (time view and frequency view) of physiological signals to mine more positive samples, which overcomes the drawback of popular InfoNCE and achieves semantic-level representation learning; (2) we extend our framework with a memory module, implemented by a queue and a moving-averaged encoder, to enlarge the pool of negative candidates and keep the up-to-date representation; (3) extensive experiments conducted on sleep stage classification demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared with SSL baselines, achieving 71.6% and 57.9% accuracies on two sleep datasets, SleepEDF and ISRUC respectively.

The recent development of the neural hyperbolic geometry has demonstrated its effectiveness to model continuous hierarchical structures, which have been typically cumbersome to model by standard deep neural networks. This facet provides an additional by-product of a compact representation. Inspired by the favorable geometry of the hyperbolic geometry, we developed a hyperbolic ResNet for speaker recognition.

Therefore, in this paper, a “Progressive Subtractive Recurrent Lightweight Network” is proposed for video deraining. Initially, the Multi-Kernel feature Sharing Residual Block (MKSRB) is designed to learn different sizes of rain streaks which facilitates the complete removal of rain streaks through progressive subtractions. These MKSRB features are merged with previous frame output recurrently to maintain the temporal consistency. Further, multi-receptive feature subtraction is performed through Multi-scale Multi-Receptive Difference Block (MMRDB) to avoid loss of details and extract high-frequency information. Finally, progressively learned features through MKSRB and recurrent feature merging are aggregated with fused MMRDB features which outputs the rain-free frame.

In order to address this limitation, we propose a neurally optimized decoder based on a generative model which can directly reconstruct the speech from the bitstream without a prior knowledge. The proposed decoder mainly consists of two components: 1) a dequantization model to group and dequantize related bits from the bitstream and 2) a generative model to restore the speech conditioned on the output of the dequantization model. Through experiments with mixed excitation linear prediction (MELP), Advanced multi-band excitation (AMBE), and SPEEX at around 2.4 kb/s, it is showed that the proposed model showed better performance in most of the objective and subjective evaluation compared to the conventional speech codecs.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2021.3132557","Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation(grant numbers:2021-0-00456); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9635650","Speech codecs;generative adversarial network;generative model;attention mechanism","Decoding;Speech coding;Speech codecs;Bit rate;Encoding;Convolution;Knowledge engineering","","3","","21","IEEE","3 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent advances in probabilistic surface registration implied the effectiveness of Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling with ICP-based proposals. Despite the progress, the ICP proposal is still less informed for sampling from highly multi-modal parameter space of deformation field, and hence inferred registration solutions can be of limited accuracy. In this letter, we propose to jointly learn the ICP proposal and target distribution in a unified framework, where the step-size of the proposal and the invariant distribution are both adaptively adjusted during sampling, by making full use of geometric and statistical characteristics underlying history samples. Under the conditions of adaptation diminishing, the two adaptation modules can benefit from each other, leading to boosted registration accuracy.

To get rid of the effects of pose misalignment while keep the similarity of human appearance, in this paper, we propose a Pose and Similarity based Graph Neural Network in a decoupled manner, which consists of three independent branches to emphasize the respective roles of pose, local similarity and global similarity in the final descriptions. Compared to traditional Convolutional Neural Networks which tend to output similar global features in the case of highly similar pedestrians, the developed Graph Neural Networks are able to explore local semantic relationships between body parts, resulting in more discriminative features. To further eliminate the pose variation, we incorporate human skeleton information for feature map segmentation.

From the viewpoint of final measurement, there are two kinds of effects: bias-only measurement and error-growth measurement. The bias-only measurement can be directly read from a sensing device, and each measurement is only distorted by the inherited bias error of the sensor, e.g., measuring temperature by a thermometer sensor. On the other hand, the error-growth measurement cannot be read directly but be calculated by combining multiple former sampling data, therefore multiple bias errors are accumulated in the measurement. For instance, in inertial navigation, the raw data sampled from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) are converted into a trajectory by multiple integral operations, so the errors of new sampling data are continuously added into the trajectory, and the deviation of the traced trajectory will reach an unacceptable level over time. Clearly, a good IMU trajectory strategy is the one with a less error-accumulation effect. Unfortunately, the analysis of error-growth effect remains not well studied, which motivates this work. This letter first proposes a theoretical error-growth effect analysis framework. Next, we use it to analyze three typical inertial methods, namely single-IMU method, gyro-free-IMU (GF-IMU) method, and $\omega$-free accelerometer pair (OFAP) method.

Since lower-level feature maps have higher resolution and richer context, HSB can provide additional details for better semantic segmentation.

To address those limitations, we propose a ViT-based model which incorporates multi-modal data to predict the pedestrian crossing intention.

However, the existing clustering-based RSS methods depend heavily on prior knowledge to achieve excellent performance, which may bring severe challenges to RSS in actual scenarios. This letter proposes a novel subspace decomposition based adaptive density peak clustering (SD-ADPC) method to address the problems of low accuracy and high computational cost in RSS. First, the original complex radar signal data is directly decomposed into two-dimensional (2D) subspace by t-distributed random neighborhood embedding (t-SNE). Then, based on the outlier detection of the products between the peak density and the distance of the data points, ADPC is used to adaptively determine the optimal clustering centers of the original data in 2D subspace. Finally, the reminding data is assigned to its nearest cluster with Euclidean distance in one step. The experimental results of the simulated RSS dataset and the open baselines show that our proposed method does not require any knowledge and can achieve better or competitive performance in terms of accuracy and computational cost, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2021.3139528","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571043); 111 Project of China(grant numbers:B14010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9667203","Electronic warfare;density peak clustering;electronic support measurement;radar signal sorting","Radar;Sorting;Anomaly detection;Computational efficiency;Signal processing algorithms;Reconnaissance;Radio frequency","","30","","31","IEEE","31 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address these problems, we propose a recursive triple-path learning network (RTLNet) for cross-modality interactions in the decoder using global context and cross-modality fusion modules.

Estimating rare event probabilities using Monte Carlo techniques is computationally expensive, often to the point of intractability, and special methods are required. Importance sampling (IS) is a well known technique that uses a proposal distribution in place of a target distribution to lower the variance of the estimator. Key to the success of IS methods is the choice of a proposal distribution, or the parameters governing the distribution. Adaptive importance sampling improves the parameters of a family or population of proposal distributions iteratively through trials. We present a novel cross-entropy population Monte Carlo algorithm, which adapts the parameters of proposals through the cross-entropy method. The proposed method stands apart from previous work in that we are not optimizing a mixture distribution. Instead, we leverage deterministic mixture weights and optimize the distributions individually through a reinterpretation of the typical derivation of the cross-entropy method. Demonstrations on rare event examples show that the algorithm can outperform existing resampling based population Monte Carlo methods, especially for higher-dimensional problems.

Previous work based on BERT utilizes only text (language) representation to fine-tune BERT, while ignoring the importance of nonverbal information. Due to the fact that features extracted from a single modality may contain uncertainty, it is challenging for BERT to perform well in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a multimodal fusion BERT that can explore the time-dependent interactions among different modalities. Additionally, prior BERT-based methods tend to train the models with only one optimizer to update the parameters. However, we argue that BERT has been pre-trained with a lot of corpora so it needs to be fine-tuned slightly. Therefore, an internal updating mechanism is introduced to avoid the overfitting of the model in the training process. We set two optimizers for multimodal fusion BERT and other components of the model with different learning rates, which enables the model to attain optimal parameters.

To address the above issues, we propose a multi-scale temporal transformer (MTT) in this letter, for skeleton-based action recognition. Firstly, the raw skeleton data are embedded by graph convolutional network (GCN) blocks and multi-scale temporal embedding modules (MT-EMs), which are designed as multiple branches to extract features in various temporal scales. Secondly, we introduce transformer encoders (TE) to integrate embeddings and model the long-term temporal pattern. Moreover, we propose a task-oriented lateral connection (LaC) aiming to align semantical hierarchies. LaC distributes input embeddings to the downstream transformer encoders (TE), according to semantical levels. The classification headers aggregate results from TE and predict the action categories at last.

The interference waves entering the duct cause disturbance to the conventional FBANC controller and even result in divergence of the control filter. This is due to the omni-directivity of the error microphone. The differential microphone array (DMA) can be constructed in a compact size using only one more omni-directional microphone. The DMA forms a frequency-invariant beampattern that presents configurable nulls. When the output of the DMA is used as the error signal, the null can be designed to enhance the robustness of the FBANC system against interferences. However, this differential error signal is converted from the sound pressure gradient instead of the sound pressure. The DMA’s location does not precisely indicate the control point where optimum noise reduction has been achieved. To solve this problem, an auxiliary filter based mapping (AFMap) method is developed to map the differential error signal to the location of an omni-directional microphone in the DMA.

Classical distribution models are unable to fully and accurately characterize the fluctuation properties of RCS in radar targets. In this letter, we present a novel distribution model for describing and analyzing the statistical properties of dynamic RCS. We used RCS statistical data for different attitude angle ranges and performed comparative analysis with Gaussian mixture density models (GMDM) (the second-order GMDM and the third-order GMDM). To evaluate the effectiveness and performance of our proposed method, we calculated various evaluation indicators of the three models. The results suggest that the proposed model has better fitting effect and higher fitting accuracy than the second-order GMDM. Simultaneously, although its performance on the backward RCS data is slightly inferior to that of the third-order GMD, our model requires fewer parameters. So, the model can be more suitable for describing the fluctuation characteristics of dynamic RCS of radar targets. The findings are useful in the detection of radar targets and provide an alternative for improving the total performance of radar.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2021.3125261","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61903298/61873201/61773016); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1201500); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9601248","Radar targets;radar cross-section;statistical properties;probability density function","Radar cross-sections;Radar;Mathematical models;Fitting;Data models;Atmospheric modeling;Radar detection","","6","","28","IEEE","4 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Besides, due to ignoring the merits of physical model in visibility restoration and the properties of depth features in clarity improvement, we observe that only relying on the transfer capability of unpaired adversarial learning will suffer from low-quality recovery. To this end, we develop an effective end-to-end unpaired image dehazing method by integrating a physical-guided restoration stage and a depth-guided refinement stage in a GAN framework, named as PDR-GAN. Specifically, the dark channel prior is embedded in the restoration stage to provide constraints for the network, and the preliminary dehazed image is first generated. For the refinement stage, we excavate the potential relationship between the depth and transmission map to better refine the results of the previous stage and further recover the distant area details. Our framework benefits from the stage-wise learning strategy of model-based restoration and feature-based reconstruction, which is especially helpful for image dehazing when paired data is not available. Experimental results show that our method is superior to the current unpaired dehazing approaches in terms of both quantitative and qualitative.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3147434","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9698994","Depth features;physical model;single image dehazing;stage-wise training;unpaired learning","Image restoration;Training;Atmospheric modeling;Image reconstruction;Data models;Task analysis;Mathematical models","","22","","36","IEEE","1 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although several deep unsupervised hashing methods have been proposed lately, their effectiveness is far from satisfactory in practice owing to two drawbacks. On the one hand, they mostly construct binary similarity matrices which could neglect the confidence differences among multiple similarity signals. On the other hand, they ignore the desired properties of hash codes (i.e., independence and robustness). In this paper, we propose an effective unsupervised hashing method called Hashing via Structural and Intrinsic siMilarity learning (HashSIM) to tackle these issues in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, HashSIM utilizes both highly and normally confident image pairs to jointly build a continuous similarity matrix, which guides hash code learning via structural similarity learning. Moreover, inspired by contrastive learning, we impose an intrinsic similarity learning objective, which can maximally satisfy the independence and robustness properties of hash bits. Extensive experiments on three popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that our HashSIM outperforms a broad range of state-of-the-art baselines.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3148674","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFF1200902); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:31871342); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9705618","Learning to hash;unsupervised learning;deep learning;image retrieval","Codes;Semantics;Feature extraction;Training;Robustness;Binary codes;Mathematical models","","15","","42","IEEE","7 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Instead of reconstructing original skeleton sequence, we learn distinctive 3D action representation with autoencoder network by reconstructing normalized motion sequence extracted from original input. To obtain the normalized motion sequence, we specifically design a novel spatial-temporal asynchronous normalization (STAN) method, which normalizes original skeleton sequence in two steps. First, STAN reduces redundant temporal information and extracts motion sequence by subtracting mean value along the temporal dimension. Second, STAN further normalizes the motion sequence along the spatial dimension and generates normalized motion sequence that suffers less from the effect of different human body shapes.

Specifically, an orthogonality constrained ridge regression model is proposed to reduce the dimensionality of features, and a dynamic sub-network (DOPNet) is designed to learn to perform DR. After trained with an orthogonality loss and a regression one, DOPNet generates a set of orthogonal bases (i. e., weights in FC layers) dynamically to reduce the feature dimensionality for a discriminative model in the online tracking. Based on the novel discriminative model and DOPNet, an effective and efficient tracker, DOPTracker, is developed.

By RDH, after data extraction, the cover image can be restored without information loss. Among numerous existing RDH techniques, multiple histograms modification (MHM) is a general reversible embedding framework, and it is experimentally verified better than the traditional single histogram based methods. However, the expansion-bins-determination process for MHM is conducted through naive exhaustive search, which is time consuming. Based on this consideration, a fast expansion-bins-determination method for MHM is proposed in this paper. Specifically, to determine the optimal expansion bins, instead of solving the optimization problem of discrete variables, we consider a general form of this problem with differentiable objective function and real variables, so that advanced analysis tools such as Lagrange multiplier can be utilized. By the proposed approach, compared with the original MHM, the expansion bins can be determined quickly with only a tiny performance loss, and thus the practicality of MHM is improved.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3149706","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972031,U1736213,61872203); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFC3340602); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9707651","Reversible data hiding;expansion and shifting;multiple histograms modification;fast parameters determination","Histograms;Complexity theory;Optimization;Image restoration;Data mining;Nickel;Linear programming","","17","","31","IEEE","8 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Under this setup, we first derive an exact expression of the objective and reveal the existence of a fundamental trade-off in deciding the jamming power allocation, for which a simple one-dimensional search is employed to find the optimal solution. To simplify the analysis, we further derive a tight approximation of the objective and then develop a very fast alternating optimization algorithm to find the sub-optimal jamming power allocation. Moreover, we extend our analysis to the case where the channel state information is available at the suspicious transmitter via channel feedback.

However, they only consider the inter-frame temporal correlations of a uniform scale between frames, ignoring the inter-frame temporal correlations of different scales. In addition, the high computational cost is another drawback of the current video deraining algorithms. To this end, we propose a novel aggregation network that explores the inter-frame multi-scale temporal correlations for video deraining with the small computational cost. First, we construct a hybrid multi-scale feature extraction structure in the network to increase the receptive field of multi-scale features. For similar rain streaks at adjacent frames with different scales, a hybrid multi-scale residual block (HMSRB) is proposed to explore the complementary and redundant information at the temporal dimension to characterize the target frame. At the same time, we introduce an improved global context module (GCM) to avoid the complex motion estimation and motion compensation (ME&MC) operation as in previous video deraining approaches, while reducing the calculation complexity. Finally, a fusion block is utilized to adaptively merge the extracted features.

While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in feature extraction and audio classification, it is important to note that real-time audios are dependent on previous scenes. Also, the main drawback of deep learning algorithms is that they need a huge number of datasets to indicate their efficient performance. In this paper, a recurrent neural network (RNN) combined with CNN is proposed to address this problem. Moreover, a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) is used for high-quality data augmentation. This data augmentation technique is applied to the UrbanSound8K dataset to improve the environmental sound classification. Batch normalization, transfer learning, and three feature representations map are used to improve the model accuracy. The results show that the generated images by DCGAN have similar features to the original training images and has the capability to generate spectrograms and improve the classification accuracy.

In these methods, the user inputs can be provided by drawing bounding boxes over image objects, drawing scribbles or planting seeds that help to differentiate between image boundaries or by interactively refining the missegmented image regions. Due to the variety in the types and the amounts of these inputs, relative assessment of different segmentation methods becomes difficult. As a possible solution, we propose a simple yet effective, statistical segmentation method that can handle and utilize different input types and amounts. The proposed method is based on robust hypothesis testing, specifically the DGL test, and can be implemented with time complexity that is linear in the number of pixels and quadratic in the number of image regions. Therefore, it is suitable to be used as a baseline method for quick benchmarking and assessing the relative performance improvements of different types of user-assisted segmentation algorithms.

With these considerations, we solve the multipath phase problem without searching within 3D beamspace data and therefore obtain the target elevation angle with a very low computational burden.

The non-autoregressive (NAR) models can get rid of the temporal dependency between the output tokens and predict the entire output tokens in one inference step. However, the NAR model still faces two major problems. Firstly, there is still a great gap in performance between the NAR models and the advanced AR models. Secondly, it’s difficult for most of the NAR models to train and converge. We propose a hybrid autoregressive and non-autoregressive transformer (HANAT) model, which integrates AR and NAR models deeply by sharing parameters. We assume that the AR model will assist the NAR model to learn some linguistic dependencies and accelerate the convergence. Furthermore, the two-stage hybrid inference is applied to improve the model performance. All the experiments are conducted on a mandarin dataset ASIEHLL-1 and a english dataset librispeech-960 h.

However, existing approaches generally conduct representations of image regions individually which thus lack of considering the rich spatial/structural relationships among image regions. In this paper, we propose to bridge the individual regions and exploit the structural contexts among regions via a novel Region-Graph Transformer (RGTransformer).

However, labeled speaker data are usually collected from multiple sources, such as different languages, genres and devices. The single-domain adaptation methods can not deal with the complex multiple-domain mismatch problem. To address this issue, we propose a multiple-domain adaptation framework named CentriForce to extract domain-invariant speaker representations for speaker recognition. Different from previous methods, CentriForce learns multiple domain-related speaker representation spaces. To mitigate the multiple-domain mismatch, CentriForce reduces the Wasserstein distance between each pair of source and target domains in their domain-related representation space and meanwhile uses the target domain as an anchor point to draw all source domains closer to each other. In our experiments, CentriForce achieves the best performance on most of the 16 challenging adaptation tasks, compared with other competing adaptation methods.

To align with the modelingunits adopted in E2E ASR systems, subword-level (e.g., characters, BPE) LMs are usually used to cooperate with current E2E ASR systems. However, the use of subword-level LMs will ignore the word-level information, which may limit the strength of the external LMs in E2E ASR. Although several methods have been proposed to incorporate word-level external LMs in E2E ASR, these methods are mainly designed for languages with clear word boundaries such as English and cannot be directly applied to languages like Mandarin, in which each character sequence can have multiple corresponding word sequences. To this end, we propose a novel decoding algorithm where a word-level lattice is constructed on-the-fly to consider all possible word sequences for each partial hypothesis. Then, the LM score of the hypothesis is obtained by intersecting the generated lattice with an external word N-gram LM. The proposed method is examined on both Attention-based Encoder-Decoder (AED) and Neural Transducer (NT) frameworks. Experiments suggest that our method consistently outperforms subword-level LMs, including N-gram LM and neural network LM.

Unfortunately, it becomes less effective when initial input feature matches (i.e., input data) are corrupted by a large number of outliers. In this paper, we propose a new robust estimator (called TRESAC) for model estimation, where data subsets are sampled with the guidance of the triplet relationships, which involve high relevance and local geometric consistency. Each triplet consists of three data, whose relationships satisfy spatial consistency constraints. Therefore, the triplet relationships can be used to effectively initialize and refine the sampling process. With the advantage of the triplet relationships, TRESAC significantly alleviates the influence of outliers and also improves the computational efficiency of model estimation.

To mitigate this danger, we propose using a Successive Consensus Clustering framework for optimizing the pseudo-labels and the model iteratively. First, we leverage consensus clustering with respect to multiple frames of a video, which can generate high-quality pseudo-labels for pedestrians. Secondly, we develop contrastive learning based on the cluster successive memory mechanism, which can establish the correlation between different epochs of clustering so that makes the training of the model stable.

Due to the explosive growth of modern data, deep hashing has gained growing attention from research community. Recently, convolutional neural networks like ResNet have dominated in deep hashing. Nevertheless, motivated by the recent advancements of vision transformers, we propose a pure transformer-based framework, called as HashFormer, to tackle the deep hashing task. Specifically, we utilize vision transformer (ViT) as our backbone, and treat binary codes as the intermediate representations for our surrogate task, i.e., image classification. In addition, we observe that the binary codes suitable for classification are sub-optimal for retrieval. To mitigate this problem, we present a novel average precision loss, which enables us to directly optimize the retrieval accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, our work is one of the pioneer works to address deep hashing learning problems without convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We perform comprehensive experiments on three widely-studied datasets: CIFAR-10, NUSWIDE and ImageNet.

Hence, the original LBP-based framework, in fact, can not precisely extract different magnitude features in P different directions around each center pixel. Furthermore, the value of magnitude vectors can have dramatic changes from coarse areas to flat areas in the same texture image. Therefore, using a scalar threshold calculated from whole texture image can not precisely binarize all magnitude vectors in coarse areas and flat areas simultaneously. To overcome these two drawbacks, we propose a novel adaptively binarizing magnitude vector (ABMV) method. Firstly, we adaptively calculate the average vector threshold $\boldsymbol{\vec{t}_{P}}$ with P different directional values of all magnitude vectors to replace the scalar threshold t to binarize the magnitude vectors. The proposed ABMV method can more precisely extract the different magnitude features in P different directions around each center pixel. Secondly, we divide the original texture image into smaller sub-images and adaptively extract their average vector threshold from each sub-image separately. Because the correlation of the pixels in the same sub-image is stronger than that in a whole texture image, the ABMV method can more precisely extract different magnitude features from either coarse areas or flat areas. Finally, we introduce the proposed ABMV method into LBP-based framework. Extensive experiments are conducted on five representative texture databases: Outex, UIUC, CUReT, XU_HR and ALOT database. After introducing the ABMV method into CLBP, CLBC, BRINT and CJLBP, the classification accuracy and the robustness to noise of these methods can be significantly improved.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3158199","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1903213); Key Science and Technology Program of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2020GY-005); Open Project of Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Intelligent Processing for Big Energy Data(grant numbers:IPBED8); Zhejiang Provincial Commonweal Project(grant numbers:LGF21F030002); National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition(grant numbers:202100033); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9732688","Local binary pattern (LBP);adaptively binarizing magnitude vector (ABMV);threshold;average vector threshold;texture classification","Feature extraction;Databases;Standards;Robustness;Electronic mail;Data mining;Correlation","","15","","25","IEEE","10 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The recently proposed Generalized Entropic Difference (GREED) VQA model succeeds at this task, using natural video statistics models of entropic differences of temporal band-pass coefficients, delivering superior performance on predicting video quality changes arising from frame rate distortions. Here we propose a simple fusion framework, whereby temporal features from GREED are combined with existing VQA models, towards improving model sensitivity towards frame rate distortions. We find through extensive experiments that this feature fusion significantly boosts model performance on both HFR/VFR datasets as well as fixed frame rate (FFR) VQA databases. Our results suggest that employing efficient temporal representations can result much more robust and accurate VQA models when frame rate variations can occur.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3162159","YouTube; National Science Foundation AI Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning(grant numbers:2019844); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9741353","High frame rate;video quality assessment;full reference;entropy;natural video statistics;generalized Gaussian distribution;feature fusion","Streaming media;Predictive models;Entropy;Band-pass filters;Video recording;Quality assessment;Rate-distortion","","2","","23","IEEE","24 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

BASSY adopts a content-adaptive guided filtering based on local variances to estimate the proper illumination map. The salient features of the proposed approach are: (1) For the illumination component, the overall structure in the low-light image is preserved and the texture details are smoothed. (2) The reflectance is estimated without logarithmic transformation to reduce the computational burden and to avoid over-smoothing the reflectance component. (3) The adaptive gamma correction for the illumination map is used to reconstruct the enhanced image. (4) BASSY can be implemented efficiently due to the low computation complexity Ο(N).

In this case, these geometry-based graphs cannot model attribute differences between points adequately, thus limiting the compression efficiency of GFT. Hence, we firstly utilize attribute itself to refine the distance-based weight values by setting penalty function, which smoothens signal variations on graph and concentrates more energies in the low frequencies. Then, adjacency matrices acting as penalty function variables are transmitted to decoder with extra bit overheads. To balance the attribute smoothness on graph and the cost of coding adjacency matrices, we finally propose the graph based on Rate-Distortion (RD) optimization and find the optimal adjacency matrix.

The IP algorithm is based on source-wise (i.e., row-wise) updates of the demixing matrix, and lends itself naturally to an extension to overdetermined independent vector analysis (IVA) called OverIVA. In contrast, the ISS algorithm changes the whole demixing matrix at every update, making its extension to the overdetermined case non-trivial. In this paper, we propose a modified ISS algorithm for OverIVA fully exploiting the computational savings of ISS.

The essential uniqueness of CPD makes this decomposition a powerful tool in many applications as it allows for extraction of component information from a signal of interest. One popular algorithm for algebraic computation of a CPD is the generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD) which selects a matrix subpencil of a tensor, then computes the generalized eigenvectors of the pencil. In this article, we present a simplification of GEVD which improves the accuracy of the algorithm. Surprisingly, the generalized eigenvector computation in GEVD is in fact unnecessary and can be replaced by a QZ decomposition which factors a pair of matrices as a product of unitary and upper triangular matrices. Computing a QZ decomposition is a standard first step when computing generalized eigenvectors, so our algorithm can been seen as a direct simplification of GEVD.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3156870","Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique – FNRS; Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek–Vlaanderen(grant numbers:30468160); Artificiële intelligentie(grant numbers:Vlaanderen3E190661); KU Leuven Internal Funds(grant numbers:C16/15/059); ID-N(grant numbers:3E190402); Leuven Institute for Artificial Intelligence; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9733397","CPD;GEVD;multilinear algebra;QZ;tensors","Tensors;Matrix decomposition;Signal processing algorithms;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Standards;Optimization;Indexes","","2","","20","IEEE","14 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This often results in unreliable estimates with high variance, i.e., that are highly sensitive to measurement noise. To overcome this caveat, we advocate the use of Bayesian modeling. Using Bayesian statistics, we provide a comprehensive guide to handle uncertainties in MLAT, including principled choices for the likelihood function and the prior distributions. Notably, the resulting model is easy to implement and can leverage off-the-shelf Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) software for inference. Besides coping with unreliable measurements, our framework can also deal with sensors whose location is not completely known, which is an asset in mobile systems. Our solution also naturally incorporates multiple measurements per reference point, a common practical situation that is usually not handled directly by other approaches.

To facilitate implementation of the QGLMs, all weights and activations are binary. While the state of the art on training strategies for this class of models is limited to exhaustive search and single-neuron perceptron-like bit-flip strategies, this letter introduces a stochastic variational optimization approach that enables the joint training of quantum and classical layers via stochastic gradient descent. Experiments show the advantages of the approach for a variety of activation functions implemented by QGLM neurons.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3164852","European Research Council; European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program(grant numbers:725731); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9749820","Probabilistic machine learning;quantum compu- ting;quantum machine learning","Neurons;Stochastic processes;Training;Integrated circuit modeling;Optimization;Qubit;Encoding","","6","","33","IEEE","5 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, metric-based approaches have received lots of attention for their simplicity and effectiveness, but they often only use support set to generate inaccurate prototypes matching query set, ignoring the rich information contained in queries and the reversibility of the matching relationship between the two. In this letter, we propose a new simple and effective metric-based method called Bidirectional Matching Prototypical Network (BMPN), which has three innovations:1)It has an additional reverse matching process. This process uses queries to generate more accurate prototypes to improve the model’s performance while also forcing the model to learn features far from the decision boundary to enhance generalization capabilities; 2)It has a lightweight coordinate attention feature extractor (CAFE). This module not only captures long-term dependence along one spatial direction but also saving the accurate position information of the other spatial direction, helping the model to locate the region of interest more accurately; 3)It has a joint loss function, including forward matching loss and reverse matching loss, and a progressive weighting strategy is used in the training process to balance the importance of the two.

However, most existing signal-based measures are designed to be applied to single-channel signals. Measures specifically designed to take into account the binaural properties of the signal are often intrusive – characterised by requiring access to a clean speech signal – and typically rely on combining both channels into a single-channel signal before making predictions. This letter proposes a non-intrusive SI measure that computes features from a binaural input signal using a combination of vector quantization (VQ) and contrastive predictive coding (CPC) methods. vector quantized contrastive predictive coding (VQ-CPC) feature extraction does not rely on any model of the auditory system and is instead trained to maximise the mutual information between the input signal and output features. The computed VQ-CPC features are input to a predicting function parameterized by a neural network. Two predicting functions are considered in this letter. Both feature extractor and predicting functions are trained on simulated binaural signals with isotropic noise. They are tested on simulated signals with isotropic and real noise. For all signals, the ground truth scores are the (intrusive) deterministic binaural short-time objective intelligibility (STOI). Results are presented in terms of correlations and mean-squared error (MSE) and demonstrate that VQ-CPC features are able to capture information relevant to modelling SI and outperform all the considered benchmarks – even when evaluating on data comprising of different noise field types.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3161115","RISE Exchange Program through the German Academic Exchange Service; Augmented Auditory Intelligence; German Ministry of Education and Research(grant numbers:16SV8594); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9739900","Contrastive predictive coding;non-intrusive speech intelligibility prediction;self-supervised representation learning","Feature extraction;Training;Indexes;Speech processing;Speech coding;Speech recognition;Predictive models","","2","","39","IEEE","22 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, the FET consists of three parts: Feature Extraction Module (FEM), Feature Interaction Module (FIM) and Feature Decode Module (FDM). The FEM is used to efficiently extract low-level features from input images. Unlike CNN-based strategies, the FIM enables our model to capture global dependencies by self-attention, thus improving the accuracy for human pose estimation. The FDM is a multistage way that gradually recovers the size of the features to obtain a higher-quality target heatmap. In addition, Feature Squeeze Attention is introduced in the FET to further improve the overall performance of our model.

Precise alignment of these local features can enhance the learning of modality-invariant face representations, thereby improving the performance of NIR-VIS FR. Therefore, in this letter, we propose an intrinsic structured graph alignment (ISGA) module that aims to obtain a graph-level local feature alignment across modalities. To this end, we first construct an intrinsic structure graph to model the inherent structural relationships of local features, and then enhance the discriminative feature representation by aligning the graphs between modalities. To jointly encourage cross-modality class consistency between semantics and structural relationships, a cross-modality class distribution (CMCD) loss is proposed to add an identity-preserving constraint to each class distribution in the embedding space between two modalities. To solve the resulting problem of suppressed class divisibility, we maximize the mutual information between inputs and class predictions. Extensive experiments on challenging NIR-VIS datasets indicate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts.

When the EMD-based algorithms are applied to decompose a signal polluted with noise in some regions, the noise will spread into the clean region and introduce errors in the IMFs. During the real-time computation of an EMD-based algorithm, the signal is partitioned into a series of overlapping time windows. Points outside the window are discarded, they act as an error source and the error will spread into the window. We will prove that the above two problems are mathematically identical. Due to the complex nature of the sifting iteration, a mathematical theory for the error analysis of the boundary effect is still lacking. Previous studies mainly rely on simulations, and the results show that the error seems to be confined locally near the boundary. Beginning with one sifting iteration, which is the kernel of an EMD-based method, we will theoretically analyze the boundary effects completely based on the sifting process without any approximations, and prove that the error will propagate into the interior domain and may be amplified and thus obscure the meaning of an IMF. Then, we will prove a sufficient condition for the exponential decay of the error. When the error is amplified, we propose a method to resolve this problem.

The remaining sinusoidal noise (LPF output) is used effectively not only to update the FIR controller but also to scale the AWGN, while the broadband noise (LPF error) serves as a desired signal for the OSPM. In this way, the hostile coupling between the FIR controller and the OSPM subsystem is significantly mitigated, leading to both faster system convergence and improved noise reduction performance (NRP).

To date, advanced signal processing techniques are used to address this task, but it still remains a challenge to maintain a high speech quality at all time-scales. Inspired by the success of speech generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), we propose a novel unsupervised learning algorithm for time-scale modification (TSM) of speech, called ScalerGAN. The model is trained using a set of speech utterances, where no time-scales are provided. The ScalerGAN algorithm is composed of a generator that gets as input speech with the desired rate and outputs a time-adjusted speech; a discriminator that works on various spectrum scales; and a decoder that converts the time-adjusted signal back to the original rate to maintain consistency. Using an A/B test and conditional A/B test, human listeners were asked to compare ScalerGAN with other state-of-the-art TSM methods. The results showed that the speech quality of ScalerGAN outperforms all other methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3164361","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9747953","Deep neural networks;generative adversarial networks;speech synthesis;time-scale modification","Spectrogram;Generators;Signal processing algorithms;Decoding;Training;Vocoders;Time-domain analysis","","11","","31","IEEE","1 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A huge portion of the system resources is dedicated as orthogonal pilots for accurate channel estimation which imposes a huge training overhead. This overhead can be highly mitigated by exploiting intrinsic angular domain sparsity of massive MIMO channels and the sporadic traffic of users, i.e., few number of users are active to send or receive data in each coherence interval. Besides, the continuous-valued angles of arrival (AoA) corresponding to each active user are alongside each other forming a specific cluster. To exploit these features in this work, we propose a blind clustering algorithm based on super-resolution techniques that not only detects the spatial features of the active users but also provides accurate channel estimation. Specifically, an off-grid atomic norm minimization is proposed to obtain the AoAs and then a clustering-based approach is employed to identify which AoAs correspond to which active users. After active user detection, an alternating-based optimization approach is performed to obtain the channels and transmitted data. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in AoA detection as well as data recovery which indeed provides a high performance spatial-based RA in crowded massive MIMO systems.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3165759","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9751390","Crowded massive MIMO;random access;super-resolution;atomic norm;semi-definite programming;convex opti- mization","Massive MIMO;Channel estimation;Signal processing algorithms;Superresolution;Optimization;Task analysis;Feature extraction","","6","","28","IEEE","7 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In comparison, the filtered-X normalized least-mean-square (FxNLMS) algorithm can obtain lower steady-state errors through adaptive optimization. Nonetheless, its slow convergence has a detrimental effect on dynamic noise attenuation. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid SFANC-FxNLMS approach to overcome the adaptive algorithm’s slow convergence and provide a better noise reduction level than the SFANC method. A lightweight one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) is designed to automatically select the most suitable pre-trained control filter for each frame of the primary noise. Meanwhile, the FxNLMS algorithm continues to update the coefficients of the chosen pre-trained control filter at the sampling rate.

We here utilize supervised contrastive loss originated from contrastive learning as an analytical tool to characterize the class similarity structure of ASVspoof 2019 logical access (LA) dataset, which shows that an ideal back-end classifier for synthetic speech detection should have the ability to capture long-term dependencies. Recently, Transformer has been found to have an excellent ability in learning long-term dependencies of input data. We hence propose a back-end classifier based on Transformer Encoder for synthetic speech detection.

Compared to two-dimensional convolution, one-dimensional convolution makes better architectural assumptions about the input speech features, which helps with modeling long-term dependencies and decreases the risk of overfitting.

To deal with the large amounts of redundancy in tensorial data, different dimensionality reduction methods such as low-rank tensor decomposition have been developed. While low-rank decompositions capture the global structure, there is a need to leverage the underlying local geometry through manifold learning methods. Manifold learning methods have been widely considered in tensor factorization to incorporate the low-dimensional geometry of the underlying data. However, existing techniques focus on only one mode of the data and exploit correlations among the features to reduce the dimension of the feature vectors. Recently, multiway graph signal processing approaches that exploit the correlations among all modes of a tensor have been proposed to learn low-dimensional representations. Inspired by this idea, in this letter we propose a graph regularized robust tensor-train decomposition method where the graph regularization is applied across each mode of the tensor to incorporate the local geometry. As the resulting optimization problem is computationally prohibitive due to the high dimensionality of the graph regularization terms, an equivalence between mode-$n$ canonical unfolding and regular mode-$n$ unfolding is derived resulting in a computationally efficient optimization algorithm. The proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real tensors for denoising and tensor completion.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3170251","NSF(grant numbers:CCF-1615489,DMS-1924724); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9763420","Tensors;principal component analysis;geometric modeling;robustness","Tensors;Principal component analysis;Correlation;Optimization;Geometry;Matrix decomposition;Manifold learning","","6","","23","IEEE","26 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the assumption is easily violated for real-world data, e.g., color images and multispectral images, as the low-rank structure of these data is not significant. To better take advantage of the global correlation relationship, we propose a kernel low-rank tensor completion model, where original data is mapped into the feature space using a kernel mapping. Although the original data is high-rank, it is low-rank in the feature space owing to the kernel mapping. Therefore, the proposed model could take advantage of the implicitly low-rank structure in the feature space and estimate the missing entries well.

Taking advantage of the characteristics of the residual module, we disconnect the unimportant residual mapping and reserve only the identity mapping, thereby equivalently removing the corresponding residual module and achieving the purpose of layer pruning. We adopt Taylor expansion to estimate the impact of disconnecting BN layers in the residual mapping. These impacts are then normalized and used to identify unimportant residual blocks to prune. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that LPSR not only reduces the number of parameters and calculations, but also significantly speed up the inference.

In response, this paper presents a novel end-to-end learning-based method to estimate the dense correspondence of 3D point clouds, in which the problem of point matching is formulated as a zero-one assignment problem to achieve a permutation matching matrix to implement the one-to-one principle fundamentally. Note that the classical solutions of this assignment problem are always non-differentiable, which is fatal for deep learning frameworks. Thus we design a special matching module, which solves a doubly stochastic matrix at first and then projects this obtained approximate solution to the desired permutation matrix. Moreover, to guarantee end-to-end learning and the accuracy of the calculated loss, we calculate the loss from the learned permutation matrix but propagate the gradient to the doubly stochastic matrix directly which bypasses the permutation matrix during the backward propagation.

The proposed method is differentiated from conventional spectral recovery in that the coefficients to be recovered are interleaved with the transmitted coefficients to obtain the most data correlation. Further, it enhances the transmitted coefficients, which are degraded by quantization errors, to deliver better information to the recovery process. The spectral recovery is conducted recursively on a band basis such that information recovered in one band is used for the recovery in subsequent bands.

To address this issue, we propose the idea of simulating the process of point cloud completion with local-to-global reasoning (LGR). Motivated to achieve the fine LGR, a novel mutual information (MI) maximization-based similarity operation is proposed, which realizes the reconstruction from incomplete point cloud to complete one by maximizing MI between global features and the prior features from the same 3D object. We adopt the Jenson-Shannon MI estimator to maximize the MI between global features and the priors in specific dimensions, which effectively increases the similarity of global and prior features. Compared with other existing works and similarity operations, the superior results indicate the efficacy of the proposed method and its advantages over existing ones in both the synthetic and real-world datasets.

To tackle this problem, we propose an Edge-enhanced Transformer (ET) for tampered region localization. Specifically, to capture rich tampering traces, a two-branch edge-aware transformer is built to integrate the splicing edge clues into the forgery localization network, generating forgery features and edge features. Furthermore, we design a feature enhancement module to highlight the artifacts of the edge area in forgery features and assign weight values to the resulting tensor in spatial domain for vital signal strengthening and noise suppression.

To address both of these issues we propose ZoomGAN, a model that takes as input the whole low-resolution image, which we call context, and a binary mask that specifies with a box which image detail in the low-resolution image to magnify. The output of ZoomGAN has the same size as the inputs so that the scaling factor is implicitly defined by the arbitrary size of the mask box. To encourage a realistic and high-quality output, we combine adversarial training with a perceptual loss. We use two discriminators: one promotes the similarity between the distributions of real and generated details and the other promotes the similarity between the distributions of real and generated (detail, context) pairs.

Specifically, for ETJ, E first eavesdrops the suspicious signal of the ST in the ST-SU phase and then jams the SD in the SU-SD phase; for JTE, E first jams the SU in the ST-SU phase and then eavesdrops the suspicious signal of the SU in the SU-SD phase. However, in both strategies, as the jamming power of E (independent variable) changes, the SU can also adaptively adjust its deployment (dependent variable) to maximize the benefit of the suspicious system. Facing this challenge, we can only employ the undesirable exhaustive search over both the independent and dependent variables to achieve the optimal solution.

However, the domain gap between the synthetic data for model training and the realistic data for testing degrades SR performance significantly, which discourages the application of SR models in practice. One possible solution is to learn from unpaired real-world LR and HR images for their accessibility. Predominant strategies are mainly based on unsupervised domain translation. Despite great advances, there are still noticeable domain gaps between the realistic-like/synthetic-like images generated by unpaired translation and the true realistic/synthetic ones. To address this problem, this letter proposes an effective unsupervised SR framework based on dual synthetic-to-realistic and realistic-to-synthetic translations, namely DTSR. Specifically, to bridge the domain gap between testing and training data, the SR model is optimized using HR images and their realistic-like LR counterparts produced by the synthetic-to-realistic translation. In turn, we propose to narrow the domain gap further via applying the realistic-to-synthetic translation to realistic LR images prior to super-resolving, which also makes the SR model super-resolve simpler examples in testing relative to model training. Moreover, focal frequency and bilateral filtering losses are particularly introduced into DTSR for better details restoration and artifacts suppression.

Combined with the existing margin-based classification losses, NAMA improves the robustness of feature embedding by assigning larger margins to more recognizable samples. NAMA is a fully trainable module that automatically models the correlation between the optimal margin and image quality during back-propagation without supervision. To stabilize the training and make the assigned margin more controllable, we introduce a margin re-balance mechanism to align the expectation of learned margins to a pre-defined value.

It is considered that the local parts naturally mitigate the variation of intra-identity samples caused by cross-view. Thus, the Self-Label Refining (SLR) module estimates the similarities between global and local pseudo labels with clustering consensus, and then it refines the global pseudo labels by integrating propagated local pseudo labels into global pseudo labels. Meanwhile, a symmetric ClusterNCE loss is further proposed to enhance the robustness of the network to noisy labels.

To address the issue, the self-attention-based autoregressive axial transformer has been proposed to apply attention along a single axis of the feature maps instead of the whole ones with large receptive fields. It performs axial-attention twice along the height- and width-axis respectively in the spatial dimension of the feature maps for the image data. However, there is still room for improvement. We can convert the 2D spatial feature map into a 1D feature sequence and just perform axial-attention once along it to save more computing resources. Motivated by the insight, we propose an Efficient Axial-Attention Network (EAAN) for video-based person re-identification (Re-ID) to reduce computation and improve accuracy by serializing feature maps with multi-granularity and reducing the number of axial-attention runs. We also introduce a deserialization approach that can restore the shape of the feature maps. Moreover, we expand the CTN (Channel Transformer Network) to a wider range of uses. Additionally, we verify that the serialized feature sequence can enhance expressiveness in our EAAN with lower complexity.

Specifically, we leverage the Fourier transform and its inverse to swap the low-frequency amplitude component of the source data with the target data. To effectively map style and relieve the artifacts, we introduce two factors to control the replacing area: the distance of HSV distribution between source and target images; and the difference between the source left image and its warped left image.

Most existing methods mainly focus on training models from a large amount of labeled data. However, labeling social relations in videos is time-consuming. To solve this problem, we propose a Pre-trained Multimodal Feature Learning (PMFL) framework for self-supervised learning from unlabeled video data, and then transfer the pre-trained PMFL to downstream social relationship recognition task. First, the space-time interaction between visual instances, and cross-modal interaction between visual and textual information provide important cues for social relation understanding.

There exist some fake news detection methods that focus on information exploration and utilization from multiple modalities, e.g., text and image. However, how to effectively learn both modality-invariant and event-invariant discriminant features is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Modality and Event Adversarial Networks (MEAN) for fake news detection. It contains two parts: a multi-modal generator and a dual discriminator. The multi-modal generator extracts latent discriminant feature representations of text and image modalities. A decoder is adopted to reduce information loss in the generation process for each modality. The dual discriminator includes a modality discriminator and an event discriminator. The discriminator learns to classify the event or the modality of features, and network training is guided by the adversarial scheme. Experiments on two widely used datasets show that MEAN can perform better than state-of-the-art related multi-modal fake news detection methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3181893","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62076139); National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents(grant numbers:BX20180146); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019M661901); Jiangsu Planned Projects for Postdoctoral Research Funds(grant numbers:2019K024); Open Research Project of Zhejiang Lab(grant numbers:2021KF0AB05); Future Network Scientific Research Fund Project(grant numbers:FNSRFP-2021-YB-15); Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9794602","Dual discriminator;fake news detection;multi-modal generator","Feature extraction;Fake news;Blogs;Image reconstruction;Generators;Social networking (online);Deep learning","","24","","29","IEEE","13 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, we propose a novel attribute-shaped learning (ASL) framework, which can jointly perform query attributes generation and discriminative visual representation learning for few-shot recognition. Specifically, a visual-attribute predictor (VAP) is constructed to predict the attributes of queries. By leveraging the attributes information, an attribute-visual attention module (AVAM) is designed, which can adaptively utilize attributes and visual representations to learn more discriminative features. Under the guidance of attribute modality, our method can learn enhanced semantic-aware representation for classification.

However, this information is only partially leveraged by current frame-online systems. To fully exploit it, we propose an overlapped-frame prediction technique for deep learning based frame-online speech enhancement, where at each frame our deep neural network (DNN) predicts the current and several past frames that are necessary for overlap-add, instead of only predicting the current frame.

In this paper, based on AR modeling and standard deviation statistics, we propose novel front-end speech features, i.e., ARS in short form, as the input of an SSD classifier. In addition, a new back-end classifier is constructed based on the dense convolution and short connection, and we name it scDenseNet. Experimental results on the ASVspoof2019 logical access (LA) dataset demonstrate that the ARS has a strong representation and sensitivity to spoofing attacks, and achieves promising performance on SSD. The proposed scDenseNet outperforms the previous version DenseNet on both EER and t-DCF scores, and achieves the best performance when compared with other state-of-the-art classifiers studied in this paper. Furthermore, based on the proposed scDenseNet, incorporating ARS with popular features such as the linear frequency cepstral coefficients (LFCC) significantly enhances the fusion performance and yields an EER score of 0.98%.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3183951","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072484,61772571,U19B2022); Chinese National Key Research and Development Project(grant numbers:2019QY2203); State Scholarship Foundation(grant numbers:202106380129); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9799523","Autoregressive modeling;scDenseNet;speech forensics;synthetic speech detection;variance statistics","Feature extraction;Speech synthesis;Standards;Filtering;Forensics;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Windows","","13","","41","IEEE","17 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we explore the use of co-speech gestures sequence, e.g. hand and body movements, as the speaker cue for speaker extraction, which could be easily obtained from low-resolution video recordings, thus more available than face recordings. We propose two networks using the co-speech gestures cue to perform attentive listening on the target speaker, one that implicitly fuses the co-speech gestures cue in the speaker extraction process, the other performs speech separation first, followed by explicitly using the co-speech gestures cue to associate a separated speech to the target speaker.

If the Volterra kernels of a system have low-rank structure (like, e.g., kernels of bilinear systems), this major drawback can in principle be mitigated. Yet, when one seeks an exact discrete-time model of a mixed-signal chain involving that system, the existing formula that generalizes the impulse invariance principle to Volterra kernels yields discrete-time kernels that do not share the same low rank. At first sight this would seem to seriously complicate the otherwise simple discrete-time realization of low-rank kernels. We show here that this not the case. By defining a cascade operator, the structure of generalized impulse invariance can be unveiled, leading to a realization without an inordinate increase in computational complexity. Finally, we give a numerical example involving a physical system that shows the relevance of our proposal.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3185962","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9806050","Nonlinear systems;bilinear systems;Volterra model;impulse invariance","Kernel;Nonlinear systems;Linear systems;Echo cancellers;Convolution;Computational modeling;Acoustics","","3","","29","IEEE","24 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For SKG, a pair (or more) of highly correlated secret vectors (SVs) need to be respectively quantized into a pair (or more) of almost identical sequences of binary bits (i.e., keys). The literatures on SKG in the wireless community almost uniformly default on a direct quantization on SVs. On the other hand, many works on biometric template security advocate a quantization on the output of a one-way function of SVs. In this paper, we present a generalized approach for SKG called continuous encryption before quantization (CEbQ). By CEbQ, a pair of SVs of limited dimension are first transformed by a continuous encryption function into a pair of sequences of quasi-continuous pseudorandom numbers (QCPRNs) of any desired length, and then these QCPRNs are quantized into keys. We show that CEbQ can yield a much lower key error rate than direct quantization subject to standardized randomness tests.

In this paper, we discover the missing link between the words and the corpus, and accordingly propose a framework of linguistic steganalysis named LS-BGAT. Specifically, we fine-tune a large-scale pre-training BERT as the local feature extraction model and employ Graph Attention Network (GAT) as the global feature extraction model. Through ensuring collaboration between the local BERT-based features and the global GAT-based features in the joint prediction layer, we combine rich semantic and syntactic information at the sentence level with underlying global information at the corpus level.

However, distributed microphone array processing remains a challenging problem because it requires the network to be able to process inputs with varying dimensions. To address this problem, we propose a triple-path recurrent neural network (TPRNN) with multi-scale aggregation blocks for distributed microphone array multi-channel speech separation. First, we extend the single-channel dual-path recurrent neural network by additionally adding multi-scale aggregation blocks and adaptive feature fusion blocks.

Our attention also contains both types of attention. For Spatial Attention, we use class activation mapping as a supervision signal to guide the generation of it directly in space. Thus our spatial attention can pay more attention to the informative pedestrian parts of the scene and reduce background interference. For Channel Attention, the importance of each channel is obtained by the similarity between the aforementioned spatial attention and the feature map of each channel. In this manner, our channel attention is indirectly guided by class activation mapping. In addition, our attention is parameter-free, which reduces the risk of over-fitting.

In this letter, to alleviate this issue, we proposed leveraging a lightweight architecture based on Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to realize the infrared and visible image fusion in an end-to-end manner, significantly reducing the computational expenses and runtime. Concretely, we construct a search-based architecture to explore the feature representation across different modalities automatically. Then a saliency-based loss function is designed to retain both the distinct target and texture details. Motivated by the cooperative principle, we also formulate a flexible hardware-sensitive regularization constraint in our loss function for discovering efficient operations.

In this letter we propose a novel strategy to automatically learn the optimal metric for PR. We unfold a recently introduced ADMM algorithm into a neural network, and we emphasize that the information about the loss used to formulate the PR problem is conveyed by the proximity operator involved in the ADMM updates. Therefore, we replace this proximity operator with trainable activation functions: learning these in a supervised setting is then equivalent to learning an optimal metric for PR.

To this end, we make use of the deep unfolding technique and develop a model-driven deep neural architecture which is designed for this specific task. The proposed deep architecture is able to learn an alternative sensing matrix by taking advantage of the underlying unfolded algorithm such that the resulting learned recovery algorithm can accurately and quickly (in terms of the number of iterations) recover the underlying compressed signal of interest from its one-bit noisy measurements.

Several previous works have attempted to alleviate the occlusion issue, but they hardly involve the essence of the problem. In this letter, we suppose that occlusion is closely related to crowd density, so the degree of occlusion can be estimated. Therefore, we propose a Potential Object Mining strategy to adaptively obtain occluded objects for reducing broken trajectories, which re-weights detections based on the predicted density map. Additionally, for the strategy, Dense Estimator is designed to predict the density of each region in an image by employing a Transformer-based structure.

Previous works have used the Gaussian mixture model-hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) forced alignment to improve the alignment performance. However, when used with end-to-end (E2E) ASR, GMM-HMM forced alignment causes extra reliance on expertise such as pronunciation lexica. It also increases the system complexity because GMM-HMMs are very dissimilar to E2E models. To tackle these two problems, we propose an E2E-ASR-based iteratively-trained timestamp estimator (ITSE), which performs alignment between token-level transcription and speech. We train ITSE first with coarse initial alignment targets generated using connectionist temporal classification (CTC) posteriors. During training, we iteratively perform realignment to update the targets. We attribute the effectiveness of the iterative training to ITSE's two vital features. First, ITSE performs alignment using similarities between token and speech embeddings instead of frame-wise token classification posteriors. Second, ITSE uses speech embeddings that are aware of left context rather than global context. ITSE significantly outperforms CTC-based baselines in word alignment accuracy and is comparable to a GMM-HMM forced aligner. In short, ITSE is an accurate, lightweight text-to-speech alignment module implemented without expertise such as pronunciation lexica.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3190793","Youth Innovation Promotion Association; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:QYTS202011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9829287","Automatic speech recognition;end-to-end;text-to-speech alignment","Training;Hidden Markov models;Acoustics;Task analysis;Electronic mail;Decoding;Neural networks","","4","","35","IEEE","13 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To provide a comprehensive theoretical foundation for the MCC algorithm, we propose a method for transient performance analysis based on moment generating function (MGF). Since this method can efficiently calculate the expected value of the exponential term in the iterative update equation, it can avoid the discrepancies caused by introducing some approximation methods such as Taylor expansions in the analysis process. To date, there is no precedent for using this method to analyze the transient performance of the MCC algorithm.

Unlike the classical MCI model which assumes the target as a set of discrete scatterers, the ASM-based MCI equation contains three kinds of reference matrices corresponding to the point-scatterers (PSs), the line-segment-scatterers (LSSs) and the rectangular-plate-scatterers (RPSs), respectively. Hence the ASM-based MCI could resolve richer information about the object geometries. By solving the imaging equation via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, the scattering coefficients will be obtained and the target can be reconstructed according to the presetting parameter sets.

The cornerstone of CBTD framework is formulating the joint PSD and SLF estimation as a constrained matrix factorization problem, instead of addressing the factors of multi-linear rank-BTD. Further, a projection gradient-based (PG) algorithm, which has sublinear convergence, is proposed to handle the restrictions of PSD and SLF by projection on manifolds.

In recent years, linguistic steganalysis have mainly utilized deep learning techniques and make great success. But suffer from the following major disadvantages. From the perspective of model structure, current methods only extract coarse features of the text, without focusing on the fine-grained representations. In terms of application, most of the studies only focus on single hidden scene and ignore the more realistic mixed hidden scenes which are more complex and realistic. These weaknesses limit the performance and the application of linguistic steganalysis in reality. In this letter, we propose a novel linguistic steganalysis method to overcome these weaknesses. This proposed method can extract distinguished text representation which fuses hierarchical features and perform excellently in sophisticated conditions. Firstly, we adapt gated graph neural networks as the coarse graph updater to update node representations on the graph level. Then we design a fine graph updater composed of the graph attention mechanism to focus on the highlighted nodes on the node-level. Moreover, we extract the most notable feature on the dimension-level of node by the graph channel attention module. Finally, the readout function is designed to fuse the hierarchical features and make the classification.

The original DST leaks the lowest frequency (DC: direct current) components of signals into high frequency (AC: alternating current) subbands. This property is not desired in many applications, particularly image processing, since most of the frequency components in natural images concentrate in DC subband. The characteristic of filter banks whereby they do not leak DC components into the AC subbands is called regularity. While an R-DST has been proposed, it has no fast implementation because of the singular value decomposition (SVD) in its internal algorithm. In contrast, the proposed regularity-constrained fast sine transform (R-FST) is obtained by just appending a regularity constraint matrix as a postprocessing of the original DST. When the DST size is $M\times M$ ($M=2^\ell$, $\ell \in \mathbb {N}_{\geq 1}$), the regularity constraint matrix is constructed from only $M/2-1$ rotation matrices with the angles derived from the output of the DST for the constant-valued signal (i.e., the DC signal). Since it does not require SVD, the computation is simpler and faster than the R-DST while keeping all of its beneficial properties. An image processing example shows that the R-FST has fine frequency selectivity with no DC leakage and higher coding gain than the original DST. Also, in the case of $M=8$, the R-FST saved approximately 0.126 seconds in a 2-D transformation of $512\times 512$ signals compared with the R-DST because of fewer extra operations.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3195673","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:22K04084,21K04045); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9847084","DC leakage;discrete sine transform;fast implementation;regularity;rotation matrix","Discrete cosine transforms;Transforms;Signal processing algorithms;Matrix decomposition;Image coding;Signal processing;High frequency","","","","18","IEEE","1 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditionally, the selection of appropriate maskers and gain levels has been informed by expert opinion, which may not be representative of the target population, or by listening tests, which can be time- and labor-intensive. Furthermore, the resulting static choices of masker and gain are often inflexible to dynamic real-world soundscapes. In this work, we utilized a deep learning model to perform joint selection of the optimal masker and its gain level for a given soundscape. The proposed model was designed with highly modular building blocks, allowing for an optimized inference process that can quickly search through a large number of masker-gain combinations. In addition, we introduced the use of feature-domain soundscape augmentation conditioned on the digital gain level, eliminating the computationally expensive waveform-domain mixing process during inference, as well as the tedious gain adjustment process required for new maskers. The proposed system was evaluated on a large-scale dataset of subjective responses to augmented soundscapes with 442 participants, with the best model achieving a mean squared error of 0.122±0.005 on pleasantness score, validating the ability of the model to predict combined effect of the masker and its gain level on the perceptual pleasantness level. The proposed system thus allows in-situ or mixed-reality soundscape augmentation to be performed autonomously with near real-time latency while continuously accounting for changes in acoustic environments.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3194419","National Research Foundation; Ministry of National Development - Singapore(grant numbers:COT-V4-2020-1); Google Cloud Research Credits Program(grant numbers:GCP205559654); AWS Singapore Cloud Innovation Center; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9841611","Affective computing;attention;deep learning;soundscape augmentation","Recording;Psychoacoustic models;Feature extraction;Predictive models;Computational modeling;Acoustics;Convolution","","4","","32","IEEE","27 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The asynchronous events acquired by an event camera in a spatio-temporal neighborhood are collected by an Event Frame (EF). A more efficient way to store the event data is introduced, where up to eight EFs are represented as a pair of an event map image (EMI), containing the spatial information, and a vector, containing the polarity information. The proposed codec encodes the EMI using: (i) a binary map, which signals the positions where at least one event occurs in the EFs; (ii) the number of events for each signalled position; and (iii) their EF index. Template context modelling and adaptive Markov modelling are employed to encode these three types of data. The experimental evaluation for EFs generated at different time intervals demonstrates that the proposed method achieves an improved performance compared with both video coding standards, HEVC and VVC, and state-of-the-art lossless image coding methods, CALIC and FLIF. When all events are collected by EFs, a relative compression of up to 5.8 is achieved compared with the raw event encapsulation provided by the event camera.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3196599","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9850353","Lossless coding;template context modelling;adaptive Markov modelling;event camera","Cameras;Electromagnetic interference;Symbols;Image coding;Indexes;Encoding;Context modeling","","21","","15","IEEE","4 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This property is achieved with DOA estimators based on the difference coarray. However, sensor failures on sparse arrays could make these DOA estimators inapplicable. In the literature, array processing under sensor failures can be coped with array diagnosis. The failed sensors are detected first in array diagnosis, and the data on these detected failed sensors are removed next. However, errors in detecting the failure patterns degrade the performance. This letter presents coarray combinations for sparse arrays under sensor failures. In converting array data from the physical array to the difference coarray, coarray combination matrices (CCMs) aim to preserve the structures of the difference coarray under sensor failures. This condition corresponds to a system of equations with the CCMs. With prior knowledge about the failure patterns, a convex optimization problem is cast for this system of equations. The optimal CCM is pre-computed with closed-form expressions, avoids array diagnosis, and applies to coarray-based DOA estimators. Furthermore, numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the errors in DOA estimation in comparison with other methods where the data on the detected failed sensors are removed.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3196600","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 110-2222-E-002-007); Ministry of Education, Taiwan(grant numbers:NTU-110V0902); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9850368","Sparse arrays;sensor failures;difference coarr- ays;coarray combination matrices","Sensor arrays;Direction-of-arrival estimation;Array signal processing;Mathematical models;Data models;Signal processing algorithms;Geometry","","2","","22","IEEE","4 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, we propose a Multi-Projector Contrastive Learning (MPCL) to address this issue, which produces multi-view contrastive candidates to retain more comprehensive visual characteristics. In addition, we introduce a contrast regularization to construct multiple projectors as different as possible, thereby facilitating the diversity of preserved information. Finally, to promote a consistent learning process for multi-projector, we design a projector training balance strategy to adjust the learning preference of different projectors. MPCL can be applied to various CL frameworks to effectively protect visual characteristics. Experimental results show that the method performs well on subsequent tasks such as linear and semi-supervised image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

In most methods, the density maps are generated by convolving with a Gaussian kernel from the ground-truth dot maps which are marked around the center of human heads. Due to the fixed geometric structures in CNNs and indistinct head-scale information, the head features are obtained incompletely. Deformable Convolution is proposed to exploit the scale-adaptive capabilities for CNN features in the heads. By learning the coordinate offsets of the sampling points, it is tractable to improve the ability to adjust the receptive field. However, the heads are not uniformly covered by the sampling points in the deformable convolution, resulting in loss of head information. To handle the non-uniformed sampling, an improved Normed-Deformable Convolution (i.e.,NDConv) implemented by Normed-Deformable loss (i.e.,NDloss) is proposed in this paper. The offsets of the sampling points which are constrained by NDloss tend to be more even. Then, the features in the heads are obtained more completely, leading to better performance. Especially, the proposed NDConv is a light-weight module which shares similar computation burden with Deformable Convolution. In the extensive experiments, our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ShanghaiTech A, ShanghaiTech B, UCF-QNRF, and UCF_CC_50 dataset, achieving 61.4, 7.8, 91.2, and 167.2 MAE, respectively.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3198371","Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(grant numbers:ZR2021MF011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9855867","Crowd counting;normed-deformable convolution;constrained offsets;uniform sampling","Convolution;Head;Training;Visualization;Oceans;Measurement;Kernel","","11","","44","IEEE","15 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To further improve the performance of the multi-task model, an uncertainty-based approach that can adaptively adjust the loss weights of different tasks during the training process is introduced for model training.

The CSformer has a specific multi-scale framework, in which the multi-scale features, extracted by M-Swin Transformer, are fused using CS2F block. Such cross-scale fusion not only enriches the features, but also yields the multi-scale self-attention. In addition, the M-Swin Transformer block consists of the Swin Transformer block and the separable convolution based convolutional local-extraction (CLE) block, which can boost the ability of Transformer in local representation.

Several improvements based on the volumetric grid have been proposed in order to achieve spatial resolution scalability and to reduce the computational cost by using a coarser grid. In general, the problem of the volumetric based methods is that the noise and the reverberation are projected into the search space since all GCC information is used to build the acoustic map. It is hence proposed a volumetric grid SRP-PHAT algorithm based on the geometrically sampled grid (GSG) that incorporates a max-pooling (MP) operation in the volume accumulation of the GCC values in order to improve the localization performance. The MP is the solution of a minimization-maximization problem that aims at minimizing the deleterious effect of noise and reverberation and at maximizing the accuracy of the GCC values related to the target sound source.

However, unlike many standard restoration problems such as deconvolution, the forward image formation model of the atmospheric turbulence does not have a simple expression. Thanks to the Zernike representation of the phase, one can show that the forward model is a combination of tilt (pixel shifting due to the linear phase terms) and blur (image smoothing due to the high order aberrations). Confusions then arise between the ordering of the two operators. Should the model be tilt-then-blur, or blur-then-tilt? Some papers in the literature say that the model is tilt-then-blur, whereas more papers say that it is blur-then-tilt.

Consequently, Bayesian lower bounds on the mean-squared-error (MSE) are not valid bounds for periodic estimation problems. In addition, many Bayesian MSE lower bounds cannot be derived in the periodic case due to their restrictive regularity conditions. For example, the regularity conditions of the Bayesian CRB (BCRB) are not satisfied for parameters with uniform prior distribution.

This work proposes spatial focus attention for the fine-grained skeleton-based action tasks. Specifically, we decouple the attention map to enhance the grouped joint dependence adaptively by the decouple probability. To further focus on local grouped dependence, the tree structural attention maps can be built by hierarchical decoupling and guide the model to focus on complementary local dependence in the different leaf nodes.

In this letter, we propose to disentangle timbre and emotion through information perturbation to conduct cross-speaker emotion transfer, which effectively learns the emotional expression of the source speaker and maintains the timbre of the target speaker.

To address this issue, a sub-Nyquist tensor train decomposition (SubTTD)-based DOA estimation method is proposed for a three-dimensional (3-D) sparse array, where an augmented virtual array is derived from the sub-Nyquist tensor statistics. To reduce computational complexity of processing the 6-D coarray covariance tensor, the proposed SubTTD model efficiently decomposes it into a train of head matrix, 3-D core tensors, and tail matrix. Based on that, a core tensor decomposition and a change-of-basis transformation for the head matrix are designed to retrieve canonical polyadic factors of the coarray covariance tensor for DOA estimation.

Recently, the performance of speech separation has been remarkably improved with deep learning-based approaches, implying that the narrowband and aliasing components may be able to be separated. In this letter, we propose a novel method for low-rate wideband speech coding utilizing a standard narrowband codec. Instead of coding wideband speech using a wideband codec with a limited bitrate, we propose to decimate the input wideband speech incurring aliasing, and then encode it with a narrowband codec by allocating all the allowed bitrate to 0-4 kHz. After decoding the encoded bitstream, we apply a speech separation technique to obtain the narrowband and aliasing signals, which are then used to reconstruct the wideband speech by expansion, low/highpass filtering, and summation. Experimental results showed that the proposed method could achieve subjective quality comparable to the speeches coded by wideband codecs at higher bitrates in a subjective MUSHRA test.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3207381","Korean Government; Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute(grant numbers:22ZH1200); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9894063","Frequency aliasing;speech codec;audio codec;speech separation;coded signal enhancement","Speech coding;Bit rate;Wideband;Encoding;Narrowband;Decoding;Speech enhancement","","4","","48","IEEE","16 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Some methods focus on blending boundary to localize manipulation regions, discarding a part of useless information like background of image. But these methods still contain deceptive information such as facial regions without texture, which occupies resources and affects detection accuracy. Besides, these methods left out some features useful for identification. Therefore, this paper proposes a module by conducting semantic masks to guide detectors focus on face. The semantic segmentation masks focus on the facial features such as hair, eyes and other important areas, which can offer effective face identification high level semantic features. Our method uses masks as an attention-based data augmentation module and is simple for many DeepFake detection models to integrate. Experiments on multiple detectors with and without our module show our module's effectiveness. Without modifying their structural design, our approach enables CNN-based detectors to perform better.

To this end, in this work, we propose a general complex-valued unscented Kalman filter (GCUKF) algorithm which can be applied for both proper and improper signals.

In the encoder, a novel cross modality enhancement fusion module uses details from RGB maps and location information from depth maps to perform cross-modality fusion. In the decoder, the details and location information in a multimodality complementation module are repeatedly used to progressively refine the DRERNet prediction.

Also, most beamformers model the spectral coefficients of target speech using a Gaussian distribution. In this letter, a beamforming method that minimizes the $\ell _{0}$-norm of the beamformer output in the spherical harmonics domain with a distortionless constraint is proposed. The proposed method assumes a super-Gaussian prior for the target speech and sparsifies the beamformer output which is shown to reduce the residual elements of the interfering speech signals from the beamformer output leading to superior spatial separation.

Considering the fuzzy boundaries and complex gradients of FLS images, a transformer feature fusion network (TFFN) based on the transformer stack structure is proposed to promote information fusion. Additionally, we also propose a novel method called ellipse quality evaluation (EQE) to improve the reliability of localization quality estimation, reduce the false detection rate caused by low resolution, and thus improve the detection performance. Finally, we present an anchor-free method based on TFFN and EQE, called TransYOLO. Experiments show that our detector has reached an advanced level in the FLS dataset.

To fill this gap, we revisit the $k$-reciprocal distance re-ranking model in this letter, and propose a generic re-ranking method that exploits the salient skeleton features to perform $k$-reciprocal distance encoding for skeleton-based person re-ID re-ranking.

The network employs complex convolutional and pooling layers, as well as a Cartesian Scaled Exponential Linear Unit activation function to directly compute the nearly-optimum weight vector through the training process and without prior knowledge about the direction of arrival of the desired signal. This means that reconstruction of the interference plus noise (IPN) covariance matrix is not required.

In this paper, we propose a Chunk-Level Intent Detection (CLID) framework, where we introduce a sliding window-based self-attention (SWSA) scheme for regional chunk intent detection.

Recent research on Real-SR has achieved remarkable progress by degradation process modeling; however, there are still undesired structural distortions and over-smoothed textures in the recovered images. In this letter, we propose a structure and texture preserving network, towards reducing the structural distortions while refining the perceptual-pleasant textures. Specifically, we propose a structure tensor (ST) branch to guide the restoration of high-resolution images by extracting channel-aggregated structural information.

Firstly, we design a steganographic communication model that combines speech coding with embedding process by using embedded redundancy of speech messages. It is suitable for all lossy channels. Secondly, for improving the robustness of speech signals under a given embedding rate, we propose a content-aware protection method by exploiting different effects of speech coding parameters on speech quality after transcoding.

We further improve this idea by introducing the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) into the transformer architecture. As a parameterized transform with a fraction order, FrFT provides an opportunity to access any intermediate domain between time and frequency and find better-performing transformation domains.

Inspired by the Coulomb force, we in this work set each proposal as a single electric charge and define the attractive and repulsive forces to model the interaction between ground truths and assigned proposals. This design is driven by two motivations: the attractive force pulls bounding boxes toward their assigned targets, aggregating them compactly around the ground truths. The repulsive force pushes bounding boxes away from other instances, preventing them from shifting to surrounding pedestrians. With this insight, we propose a novel bounding box regression loss and achieve more robust localization performance in crowded scenes without introducing any computational overhead.

When using real-valued samples to approximate the expectation of a random variable, the variance of the resulting estimator, obtained by averaging over those samples, decreases as the number of samples increases. However, it is often useful to reduce the variance without increasing the number of samples. Using control variates is one method to achieve such variance reduction and is applicable in contexts where the random variable is unconstrained. To make it possible to use control variates with constrained variables, this paper proposes the use of a non-linear mapping from an unconstrained space to the constrained space. Results indicate that significant reductions in Monte-Carlo error was achieved with negligible additional computational cost.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3221347","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/R018537/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9944852","Constraints;control variates;Markov chain Monte Carlo;variance reduction;zero variance","Monte Carlo methods;Standards;Random variables;Bayes methods;Aerospace electronics;Probabilistic logic;Markov processes","","","","19","IEEE","10 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the size of the data collection increases, its principal component (PC) tends to the covariance eigenvector. The downside of PCA is that it is very sensitive against any outliers in the data collection. L1-PCA is an increasingly popular robust alternative to standard PCA that has demonstrated sturdy resistance against outliers in a number of applications. However, to date, the asymptotic properties of L1-PCA as an eigenvector estimator are not well understood.

In contrast to the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion in the original GUF framework, GL-GUF combines the strength of the GL in robust information learning against non-Gaussian disturbances and the advantages of GUF in handling strong model nonlinearity with high accuracy and good stability. More importantly, by establishing the linear regression model to obtain residual vectors and introducing the negative log-likelihood of GL, simultaneously, GL-GUF optimizes free parameters to avoid manual parameter tuning.

PFRNet is an encoder-decoder-based dual-branch structure with interactive improved real & complex transformers. In PFRNet, the fusion rectification block is proposed to convert the implicit relationship of the two branches into a fusion feature by the frequency-domain mutual attention mechanism. The fusion feature provides a platform for the interaction in the middle layers.

Within a Bayesian context, prior distributions are assigned to both unknowns to regularize the BD problem. A common approach is to use Gaussian priors. Nonetheless, the latter do not alleviate the so-called scale ambiguity that prevents from efficiently sampling the joint posterior distribution and building appropriate estimators. In this paper, we instead use a Von–Mises prior that removes scale ambiguity and we focus on the design of a sampling scheme of the joint posterior. The latter may exhibit multiple modes. We propose accordingly a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo method that prevents samples from lingering in local modes. Compared to state-of-the-art techniques, the algorithm shows an improved within- and between-mode mixing property with synthetic data.

To deal with this problem, we present an alternative theoretical model of the unconstrained PBFDAF by introducing a modified time-domain weight vector. We show that the new weight vector can converge to the true system impulse response in the mean sense. We also derive the analytical expressions for the MSD and the MSE. The analysis here is equivalent to that in our previous work, but the former is much simpler and easier to handle.

We introduce an online method for training a perceptron-based context-adaptive arithmetic coder on-the-fly, called adaptive perceptron coding, which continuously learns the context probabilities and quickly converges to the signal statistics.

An mmWave system usually has a large number of antennas but few RF chains, which restricts the effective antenna size. The angle estimation problems of mmWave and radar systems are similar, but there are differences. In particular, in the problem formulation of angle estimation for mmWave systems, we have path gains instead of source symbols. The path gains in mmWave channels are typically modeled as Gaussian random variables. We show that the critical non-Gaussian assumption for using fourth-order coarrays can be circumvented by using a submatrix of a banded Toeplitz matrix for analog combining. The combiner can be designed so that the conditions for applying fourth-order coarrays are satisfied asymptotically.

The new linear operator introduced here stems from the fundamental solution of the wave equation combined with the receivers' responses.

Other than beamforming, these methods usually require additional SIC techniques to provide a part of isolation, which brings higher system complexity. In this letter, a SIC method is proposed to overcome these issues. By developing a transmit SIC beamformer design that minimizes the power of SI on a per-antenna basis, we can obtain more isolation before the ADCs in each receiving channel and better prevent them all from being saturated. Then, the residual SI can be further suppressed by adaptive receive beamformers to achieve high total isolation performance. The proposed method reduces the need for other SIC techniques than beamforming technology in phased array systems and, thus, facilitates lower system complexity.

Firstly, we employ perturbation CS to compress and encrypt the double permuted images simultaneously, which can increase key space. Secondly, a normalized quantization is designed for the fused image, and it aims to save transmission consumption and conceal energy perfectly.

To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel black-box adversarial attack method, named substitute meta-learning (SML), which combines meta-learning with the training of the substitute model. Different from existing substitute training methods that rely on data augmentation tactics or refined loss functions, we aim to boost the learning efficiency of the substitute model to improve training efficiency and attack performance.

Their implementation is, however, computationally burdensome, as it requires mapping the signals from the $\alpha \beta$-fixed reference frame coordinates to the synchronous frame coordinates, where they are processed using the moving average filter, and the result is finally transformed back to $\alpha \beta$-fixed reference frame coordinates. To overcome this issue, the present letter proposes and experimentally tests an alternative filter that directly operates on the $\alpha \beta$-fixed reference frame, thus avoiding the Park transformations. This considerably reduces the computational burden to almost one fifth. The proposed filter comprises a comb-filter cascaded with a second order harmonic oscillator. The proposed filter, referred to as CF-SOHO, guarantees the extraction of the fundamental positive sequence component with unitary gain and without phase-shift from unbalanced and harmonic-distorted signals, i.e., all harmonics (including DC components) contained in the incoming signals are fully suppressed.

The main challenge of ZSM-TTS is to increase the overall speaker similarity for unseen speakers. One of the most successful speaker conditioning methods for flow-based multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) models is to utilize the functions which predict the scale and bias parameters of the affine coupling layers according to the given speaker embedding vector.

The newly designed coupling layer explicitly normalizes the input by the parameters predicted from a speaker embedding vector while training, enabling an inverse process of denormalizing for a new speaker embedding at inference.

Deepfake detection is a binary classification task that distinguishes fake faces from real ones. As the training data for deepfake detection is usually generated from real faces via various face forgery methods, it is difficult for a single binary decision boundary to distinguish fake faces. Besides that, the learned features often involve irrelevant information for identifying fake faces that are generated from diverse forgery methods. To deal with such challenges, unlike existing approaches that regard fake detection as a binary classification, we re-model the task as a multiclass forgery-domain classification task, where each forgery method is treated as a distinct class. This simplifies the complex decision boundary brought by the diversity of forgery patterns and provides more forgery-relevant information for the learning process. In addition, we introduce a non-negative constrained learning framework composed of non-negative features and a non-negative constrained classifier (NCC) to block irrelevant features with zero weights and enhance forgery-relevant features with positive weights, leading to a sparse structure of the classifier. Furthermore, to capture subtle and discriminative forgery-relevant features, we propose an integration module over augmented faces based on cross-attention. We demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance and generalization ability on widely-used benchmarks through extensive experiments.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3193590","OPPO Research Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9839430","Classifier regularization;deepfake detection;face classification;face forensics;feature integration","Faces;Forgery;Deepfakes;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Crops;Training","","14","","27","IEEE","25 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose the Multivariate Time-Series Imputation with Transformers (MTSIT), a novel method that uses transformer architecture in an unsupervised manner for missing value imputation. Unlike the existing transformer architectures, this model only uses the encoder part of the transformer due to computational benefits. Crucially, MTSIT trains the autoencoder by jointly reconstructing and imputing stochastically-masked inputs via an objective designed for multivariate time-series data. The trained autoencoder is then evaluated for imputing both simulated and real missing values.

The situation is totally different compared with the traditional RDH approaches, and the classical histogram based methods can not be utilized. To deal with this new and challenging problem, we then propose a two-steps embedding framework. Considering binary image as cover, firstly, some pixels are selected and losslessly compressed as the reconstruction information for image recovery. Then, with the adaptively defined distortion and by utilizing matrix embedding, the secret message and the reconstruction information are embedded into the cover.

However, it queries for ZOO-gradients to correct the estimated meta-gradients with a fixed frequency, thereby still leading to massive unnecessary queries. To overcome this limitation, this letter takes the dynamic changes of the accuracy of the estimated gradients as a starting point, and develops a Dynamic Meta Attack (DMA). At the beginning of each fine-tuning round, DMA computes the distance between the above two types of gradients. Such distance metric can reflect the accuracy of the meta-gradients, and guide the dynamic adjustment of query frequency for the ZOO-gradients. Moreover, the working flow of the dynamic fine-tuning process can be controlled by a set of parameters, which are of physical significance and easy to be tuned. By this means, DMA merely launches queries at critical moments, greatly saving query resource. Experiments conducted on MNIST and CIFAR10 show that the proposed DMA requires far fewer queries than existing methods while maintaining a satisfying attack success rate and distortion.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3229558","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872099,62272116,62002075,62072484); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9987691","Adversarial attack;artificial intelligence security;meta learning;query efficiency","Distortion;Optimization;Estimation;Training;Tuning;Closed box;Rate distortion theory","","6","","19","IEEE","15 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Afterward, the DGAG adaptively performs feature aggregation by evaluating the semantic dissimilarity across shots to eliminate chaotic message passing for accurate context modeling. Finally, the procedure of importance score prediction is formulated as a node classification task, and these scores are utilized for a summary generation.

"Dynamic Channel-Aware Subgraph Interactive Networks for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition","K. Wu; X.

Existing skeleton-based methods primarily focus on the spatial aspect of skeleton graphs, but rarely mine long-range temporal relationships to learn the intrinsic dependencies across different frames. The latter is crucial for extracting discriminative motion patterns. To acquire a more precise spatial-temporal representation for the human skeleton data, we develop a lightweight yet practical method termed Dynamic Channel-Aware Subgraph Interactive Network (DCA-SGIN), using the interactive motion to adaptively capture long-range temporal nuance among the skeleton sequences. Moreover, we unify a novel paradigm to address the inherent structural limitations of GCNs. Specifically, the proposed graph interactive learners utilize the collaborative channel-aware topology of multiple subgraphs to model spatial relations. Unlike previous methods, the global and local features are simultaneously considered in spatial modeling without calculating any adjacency matrix, making it more efficient. Each proposed individual component in DCA-SGIN can be treated as a plug-in module that can be easily applied to other GNNs. Extensive experiments on the three challenging datasets show that the performance of DCA-SGIN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with fewer FLOPs.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3227816","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61876158); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2682021ZTPY030); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9976184","Graph neural network;channel-aware;skeleton-based action recognition","Skeleton;Topology;Solid modeling;Adaptation models;Convolution;Computational modeling;Collaboration","","7","","41","IEEE","8 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our second method, cyclic mixture permutation invariant training (MixCycle), uses MixPIT as a building block in a cyclic fashion for continuous learning. MixCycle gradually converts the problem from separating mixtures of mixtures into separating single mixtures. We compare our methods to common supervised and unsupervised baselines: permutation invariant training with dynamic mixing (PIT-DM) and mixture invariant training (MixIT). We show that MixCycle outperforms MixIT and reaches a performance level very close to the supervised baseline (PIT-DM) while circumventing the over-separation issue of MixIT.

To address this problem, we propose a novel two-stage supervised framework. The inaccuracy of clues is modeled as uncertainty which can be estimated by training implicitly with a parameterized loss function in stage one. The bias is alleviated in stage two by regressing a lossless decomposition of frames instead of the raw rgbs. The decomposition can be achieved by several invertible cross-coupling layers, motivating the network to synthesize high-frequency details.

In this letter, channel alignment along with severe semantic constraints is proposed to alleviate the significant distribution differences between modalities. To obtain the optimum channel matching mode, a novel channel alignment mechanism termed Channel Instance Level Alignment (CILA) is proposed at the shallow layer, and matched channel features are constrained by the proposed Channel Instance Alignment (CIA) Loss. In the middle layer, we divide the features into multiple hierarchically-aware channel clusters and align the channel clusters by Channel Cluster Alignment (CCA) Loss.

Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently been adapted for low-level image processing and have achieved a promising performance. However, ViTs process images in a window- or patch-based manner, compromising their computational efficiency and long-range dependency. Additionally, existing ViTs process RGB images instead of RAW data from sensors, which is sub-optimal when it comes to utilizing the rich information from RAW data. We propose a fully end-to-end Conv-Transformer-based model, RawFormer, to directly utilize RAW data for low-light image enhancement. RawFormer has a structure similar to that of U-Net, but it is integrated with a thoughtfully designed Conv-Transformer Fusing (CTF) block. The CTF block combines local attention and transposed self-attention mechanisms in one module and reduces the computational overhead by adopting a transposed self-attention operation. Experiments demonstrate that RawFormer outperforms state-of-the-art models by a significant margin on low-light RAW image enhancement tasks.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3233005","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFB3600603); Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(grant numbers:2020J01468); Brain Pool Program; National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea(grant numbers:2021H1D3A2A01099396); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10002844","Low-light image enhancement;vision transformer;image processing;RAW camera data processing","Transformers;Convolution;Image enhancement;Image restoration;Task analysis;Computational modeling;Computational efficiency","","8","","37","IEEE","29 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, since the presence of dynamic foreground breaks the low-rank assumption, LRP sometimes fails to work for complex videos. How to effectively capture the implicit low-rankness is a tricky challenge in complex video completion. To address this challenge, we propose a video completion model, which organically combines the respective merits of deterministic LRP and deep image prior. Specifically, we first decompose a complex video into the dynamic foreground and static background, and then characterize each component individually. For the dynamic foreground, instead of the hand-crafted prior, we consider the deep foreground prior expressed by U-Net architecture in an unsupervised manner, while we consider the tensor low-rank prior for the static background. Moreover, we develop an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm under the plug-and-play framework to tackle the resulting model. Different from the classic plug-and-play framework with a pre-trained and fixed network, our algorithm can adaptively update the parameters of network during iterations, which enables the network to have a more flexible expression ability.
