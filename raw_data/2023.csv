To address this issue, in this letter, we propose a novel generation-network-based approach, called symmetric saliency-based encoder-decoder (SSED), to generate adversarial voice examples to speaker identification. It contains two novel components. First, it uses a novel saliency map decoder to learn the importance of speech samples to the decision of a targeted speaker identification system, so as to make the attacker focus on generating artificial noise to the important samples. It also proposes an angular loss function to push the speaker embedding far away from the source speaker. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SSED yields the state-of-the-art performance, i.e. over 97% targeted attack success rate and a signal-to-noise level of over 39 dB on both the open-set and close-set speaker identification tasks, with a low computational cost.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3236509","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62176211); Project of the Science, Technology, and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, China(grant numbers:JCYJ20210324143006016,JSGG20210802152546026); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10015819","Adversarial attack;speaker identification;saliency map decoder;angular loss","Signal to noise ratio;Perturbation methods;Decoding;Open systems;Convolution;Task analysis;Speech recognition","","12","","29","IEEE","12 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, as real-world 3D scenes have point-variant photograph distances (depth), a unified homography matrix is not sufficient to depict the specific pixel-wise relations between two images. Some researchers try to alleviate this problem by predicting multiple homography matrixes for different patches or segmentation areas in images; in this letter, we tackle this problem with further refinement, i.e. matching images with pixel-wise, depth-aware homography estimation. Firstly, we construct an efficient convolutional network, the DPH-Net, to predict the essential parameters causing image deviation, the rotation ($R$) and translation ($T$) of cameras. Then, we feed-in an image depth map for the calculation of initial pixel-wise homography matrixes, which are refined with an online optimization scheme. Finally, with the estimated pixel-specific homography parameters, pixel correspondences between candidate images can be easily computed for registration. Compared with state-of-the-art image registration algorithms, the proposed DPH-Net has the highest performance of 0.912 EPE and 0.977 SSIM, demonstrating the effectiveness of adding depth information and estimating pixel-wise homography into the image registration process.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3238274","Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L211014); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10021667","Homography estimation;image matching;depth-aware homography;pixel-wise image registration","Image registration;Estimation;Cameras;Training;Signal processing algorithms;Optimization;Mathematical models","","11","","42","IEEE","19 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a result, we propose a model of adaptive sparse spatially-regularized correlation filters (AS2RCF). Aiming to suppress the noise mixed in the model, we improve it by introducing an $l_{1}$-norm spatial regularization term. This converts the original ridge regression equation into an Elastic Net regression, which allows the filter to have a certain sparsity while maintaining the stability of model optimization.

That is the influences of feature quality on model performance are not considered. To fill the gap, a novel linguistic steganalysis by enhancing and integrating local and global features is proposed in this letter. It extracts and integrates the features of two dimensions, namely local semantic features and global long-term dependencies, to construct a joint feature map. Then, to improve the quality of features, a group-wise enhancement mechanism is employed, which divides features into multiple groups, enhancing important features in each group while weakening the less important ones by generating an important coefficient for each sub-feature in each semantic group. Finally, the enhanced features are used to further extract high-quality text representation to help the classification module distinguish cover and stego texts more accurately. The experimental results show that the proposed model has better detection performance in multiple hidden scenarios. The ablation experiment manifests that using integrated and enhanced features to extract high-quality text representations can effectively improve the discrimination ability of the model.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3238283","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U21B2020,U1936216); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10021965","Linguistic steganalysis;feature enhancement;local semantic feature;global long-term dependencies","Feature extraction;Semantics;Steganography;Linguistics;Field-flow fractionation;Convolution;Classification algorithms","","10","","27","IEEE","19 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Restricted isometry constant (RIC) of sensing matrix which ensures the convergence of iterative algorithms plays a key role in guaranteeing successful recovery. In the analysis of sufficient condition to ensure recovery performance, the RIC $\delta _{\text{3}s}$ is generally used in previous literature, while $\delta _{\text{2}s}$ is rarely addressed. In this letter, we first show that the theoretical optimal step-length is 1 while using sufficient condition in terms of $\delta _{\text{2}s}$. Furthermore, based on this optimal step-length, the RIC bound is greatly improved to $\delta _{\text{2}s}< (\sqrt5-1)/(2\sqrt3)\approx 0.3568$ compared to the existing one $\delta _{\text{2}s}< 0.25$ for IHT algorithm. Meanwhile, the RIC condition $\delta _{\text{2}s}< \sqrt7/7\approx 0.3780$ is developed for successful recovery via HTP algorithm.

In this letter, we propose a black-box multi-bit DNN watermarking algorithm, suitable for multiclass classification networks, whereby the presence of the watermark can be retrieved from the output of the network in correspondence to any input. To read the watermark, we first apply a power function to the softmax output of the DNN model to map it from an impulse-like to a smooth distibution. Then, we extract the watermark bits by projecting the output of the DNN onto a pseudorandom key vector. Watermark embedding is achieved by adding a proper regularizer term to the training loss. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by applying it to various network architectures working on different datasets.

Recent methods introduce novel neural radiance field (NeRF) frameworks that generalize to unseen scenes on-the-fly by combining multi-view stereo with differentiable volume rendering. These generalizable NeRF methods synthesize the colors of 3D ray points by learning the consistency of image features projected from given nearby views. Since the consistency is computed on the 2D projected image space, it is vulnerable to occlusion and local shape variation by viewing direction. To solve this problem, we present dense depth-guided generalizable NeRF that leverages the depth as the signed distance between the ray point and the object surface of the scene.

To identify the fake images, the top priority is to find what properties make the fake images different from the real images. In this letter, we reveal an important observation about real/fake images, i.e., the GAN generated fake images contain stronger non-local self-similarity than the real images. Motivated by this observation, we propose a simple yet effective non-local attention based fake image detection network, namely NAFID, to distinguish GAN generated fake images from real images. Specifically, we develop a non-local feature extraction (NFE) module to extract the non-local features of the real/fake images, followed by a multi-stage classification module to distinguish the images with the extracted non-local features. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of our NAFID over state-of-the-art (SOTA) face forgery detection methods. More importantly, since the NFE module is independent from classification, we can plug it into any other forgery detection models. The results show that the NFE module can consistently improve the detection accuracy of other models, which verifies the universality of the proposed method.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3243770","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62001016); Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program(grant numbers:2022QNRC001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10041767","Fake face detection;generative neural network;non-local similarity","Faces;Feature extraction;Forgery;Generative adversarial networks;Probability density function;Noise reduction;Security","","8","","36","IEEE","9 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Rather than considering global image degradation levels and types, previous methods only focus on local degradation and unavoidably lead to inter-patch inconsistency, like blocking artifacts in the UHR image. To address this issue, we propose a real-world super-resolution framework to integrate the restoration of different patches through a Global Degradation Supervision Super-Resolution (GDSSR) method. Specifically, a lightweight Global Degradation Extractor is used for extracting global degradation features, which can facilitate restoring better local patches independently and enforce inter-patch consistency. Additionally, a joint training method of local and global patches is proposed to exercise global supervision during the training process, which enhances the degradation estimation and restores more natural results.

DeFT-AN is a mask estimation network that predicts a complex spectral masking pattern for suppressing the noise and reverberation embedded in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) of an input signal. The proposed mask estimation network incorporates three different types of blocks for aggregating information in the spatial, spectral, and temporal dimensions. It utilizes a spectral transformer with a modified feed-forward network and a temporal conformer with sequential dilated convolutions. The use of dense blocks and transformers dedicated to the three different characteristics of audio signals enables more comprehensive enhancement in noisy and reverberant environments. The remarkable performance of DeFT-AN over state-of-the-art multichannel models is demonstrated based on two popular noisy and reverberant datasets in terms of various metrics for speech quality and intelligibility.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3244428","National Research Foundation; Ministry of Education of Korea; National Research Council of Science and Technology; Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea(grant numbers:CRC21011); Defense Acquisition Program Administration; ADD(grant numbers:UD190031RD); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10042963","Complex-spectral masking;multichannel;speech enhancement;transformer","Speech enhancement;Transformers;Noise measurement;Convolution;Time-frequency analysis;Time-domain analysis;Convolutional neural networks","","32","","38","IEEE","13 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Inappropriate settings can lead to the loss of intrinsic information within a time series. Therefore, two parameter-free methods, namely the intrinsic entropy (IE) and ensemble IE (eIE) methods, are proposed in this paper. The eIE method requires two parameters, which can be easily determined through an orthogonality test. The proposed approaches can measure instantaneous complexity; thus, they do not require a predetermined window size. White noise and three other varieties of colored noise were used to test the stability of the proposed methods, and five types of synthetic signals and logistic maps were applied for measuring instantaneous complexity and regularity. The results revealed that the IE and eIE methods exhibit satisfactory stability. Both methods provide point-by-point entropy measures for time series. The eIE method is useful for measuring the complexity of frequency and amplitude modulation. Furthermore, the periodicity of time series can be detected using the two proposed methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3244508","National Science and Technology Council of Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST111-2221-EA49-011-MY3); Higher Education Sprout Project of National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; Ministry of Education of Taiwan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10042964","Empirical mode decomposition (EMD);instantaneous complexity;intrinsic entropy (IE);signal regularity","Entropy;Complexity theory;White noise;Standards;Time series analysis;Time measurement;Size measurement","","6","","23","CCBY","13 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The sensor nodes take observations, quantize them, and send them to the fusion center through a network of relay nodes. The links in the network are assumed to satisfy certain capacity constraints in terms of the maximum number of bits that can be transmitted on the links. Furthermore, the relay nodes are assumed to satisfy flow conservation constraints, i.e., the number of bits flowing into a relay node is equal to the number of bits flowing out of it. It is shown that this flow optimization problem for estimation can be cast as a Network Utility Maximization (NUM) problem by suitably defining the utility functions at the sensors. The inference problem considered is one of parameter estimation with a linear observation model, which is studied in both Bayesian and non-Bayesian settings. Upper bounds on the mean-squared error (MSE) of optimal linear estimators are obtained in both settings, and these bounds are used to construct utility functions for the corresponding NUM problems. It is verified via simulations that the bit assignments at the sensors obtained through the solutions to the NUM problems, in both the Bayesian and non-Bayesian settings, yield considerably better estimation performance than the Max-Flow solution that simply assigns bits to the sensors in such a way as to maximize the total bits transmitted to the fusion center.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3245540","Army Research Laboratory; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign through Cooperative Agreement(grant numbers:W911NF-17-2-0196); Postdoctoral Research Associate at UIUC; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10044966","Flow optimization;sensor networks;statistical inference;Internet of Things","Optimization;Relays;Bayes methods;Estimation;Quantization (signal);Task analysis;Upper bound","","","","26","CCBY","15 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on this observation, we aim to utilize the high-frequency information of speech signals to develop better generalization ability to unknown attacks and stronger robustness against transmission and codecs.

The sparsity adaptive matching pursuit (SAMP) has been enhanced using the CCSAMP algorithm. The CCSAMP's capacity to accurately reconstruct the signal with fewer repetitions is its most novel characteristic when compared to other state-of-the-art SAMP enhancement methods. This makes it a candidate for many practical applications that need fast reconstruction. The proposed algorithm constructs two correlation vectors, which represent the input signals recovered from the support set and candidate set. The step size is transformed by their Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCS). Compared to the residual energy, the correlation coefficient is more sensitive. The CCSAMP reduces the number of iterations while maintaining the SAMP's capability of signal reconstruction without prior knowledge of the sparsity. Simulation shows that the CCSAMP can significantly reduce the number of iterations compared to the SAMP algorithm. The CCSAMP can be used for radar detection, radar 3D imaging, and other fields where fast and accurate reconstruction of signals is required.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3252469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10058562","Compressed sensing (CS);sparse reconstruction algorithm;correlation coefficient;variable step size","Matching pursuit algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Correlation coefficient;Sensors;Indexes;Image reconstruction;Backtracking","","11","","23","IEEE","3 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Utilizing a pre-trained language model, such as the bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT), could significantly improve the TTS front-end’s performance. However, the original BERT is too big for edge TTS applications with tight limits on memory costs and inference latency. Although a distilled BERT can alleviate this problem, a considerable efficiency barrier may still exist due to the self-attention module's quadratic complexity and the feed-forward module's enormous computation. To this end, we propose a lightweight distilled convolution network as an alternative to the distilled BERT. Unlike previous knowledge distillation methods, which commonly used the same self-attention network for the teacher and student models, we transfer knowledge from the self-attention network to a convolution network.

However, creating No-Reference Video Quality Assessment (NR VQA) models that can accurately predict the quality of streaming gaming videos rendered by computer graphics engines is a challenging problem, since gaming content generally differs statistically from naturalistic videos, often lacks detail, and contains many smooth regions. Until recently, the problem has been further complicated by the lack of adequate subjective quality databases of mobile gaming content. We have created a new gaming-specific NR VQA model called the Gaming Video Quality Evaluator (GAMIVAL), which combines and leverages the advantages of spatial and temporal gaming distorted scene statistics models, a neural noise model, and deep semantic features.

Even with the same person, changes in clothing can cause significant visual variations, making it challenging to identify them. Therefore, there is a need for a technique that can extract their inherent characteristics while being invariant to changes in clothing. Recent studies have utilized additional information such as gait, body parsing maps, and 3D shape to address cloth variance. However, these methods require additional processing and their effectiveness is dependent on the quality of the information provided. In this letter, we propose a two-stream model for ReID based on a single RGB image, consisting of a baseline ReID network and cloth-unrelated ReID networks. The baseline network takes the full RGB image as input, while the cloth-unrelated networks only receive cropped patches of the RGB image that include only cloth-independent identity cues such as the face and legs. We also propose a noisy patch filtering module (NPFM) to remove interference from noise patches during training. Finally, we combine features from baseline and cloth-unrelated ReID networks to perform cloth-changing person ReID. Our approach achieves a significant improvement of $+7.4\%$ for Rank-1 and $+1.7\%$ for mAP in cloth-changing environments compared to the recent state-of-the-art method. The effectiveness of our model for the cloth-changing person ReID is verified on the benchmark dataset with various ablation studies. In summary, our method can extract the unique features of an individual person in a cloth-changing environment and is robustly trained even with occluded or poorly captured data. Therefore, it can be more versatile in practical environments than existing ReID methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3262447","Institute of Information and communications Technology Planning and Evaluation; Korea Government(grant numbers:RS-2022-00155857); Artificial Intelligence Convergence Innovation Human Resources Development; National Research Foundation of Korea; Korea Government(grant numbers:2021R1A4A1032580,2022R1C1C1009334); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10083253","Person re-identification;changing cloth;filtering","Training;Filtering;Feature extraction;Noise measurement;Legged locomotion;Head;Clothing","","8","","28","IEEE","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For analysis-type priors, a dictionary defines a representation of signals that is likely to be sparse. In most situations, this dictionary is unknown, and is to be recovered from pairs of ground-truth signals and measurements, by minimizing the reconstruction error. This defines a hierarchical optimization problem, which can be cast as a bi-level optimization. Yet, this problem is unsolvable, as reconstructions and their derivative w.r.t. the dictionary have no closed-form expression. However, reconstructions can be iteratively computed using the Forward-Backward splitting (FB) algorithm. In this letter, we approximate reconstructions by the output of the FB algorithm, up to a linear transformation. Then, we leverage automatic differentiation to evaluate the gradient of this output w.r.t. the dictionary, which we learn with projected gradient descent. Experiments show that our algorithm successfully learns the 1D Total Variation (TV) dictionary from piecewise constant signals.

In this paper, we propose a speech segmentation method for streaming E2E ASR to solve the above issues. Both the decoder's dependence on acoustic information and the human average breath frequency are used for judging segment boundaries. Frame-level decoder's dependence information is provided by the Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) predictor, which optimizes jointly with ASR to guarantee a more suitable segmentation for ASR. Besides, the proposed method does not increase the model parameters and real-time factor (RTF). The experimental results show that our method can accurately detect the pauses in speech, and the segment usually contains relatively complete semantic information.

This study has the advantage of a considerably increased number of complementary codes and a very minor increase in code length. Increasing the number of codes can expand the system capacity, and short sequence length can improve the system transmission efficiency, so the constructed code sets may be applicable to high-capacity wireless communication systems.

This letter addresses the problem of selecting only a given number of temporal or spatial samples while maximizing detection performance for deterministic signals in first-order autoregressive Gaussian noise. The direct solution of this entails a combinatorial search, where the deflection coefficient is evaluated for each possible combination of sparse samples. This approach is infeasible when the number of samples is large since the number of possible combinations increases factorially with the number of samples. We present an efficient method to whiten Gaussian noise samples and express deflection coefficient in a form that is amenable to dynamic programming. Exploiting dynamic programming, we specify a feasible and efficient procedure to find optimal sparse samples where the number of computational steps increases linearly with the number of samples.

However, several characteristics of sign videos are neglected in existing transformer-based methods that hinder translation performance. Firstly, in sign videos, multiple consecutive frames represent a single sign gloss thus the local temporal relations are crucial. Secondly, the inconsistency between video and text demands the non-local and global context modeling ability of the model. To address these issues, a locality-aware transformer is proposed for sign language translation. Concretely, the multi-stride position encoding scheme assigns the same position index to adjacent frames with various strides to enhance the local dependency. Afterward, the adaptive temporal interaction module is utilized to capture non-local and flexible local frame correlation simultaneously. Moreover, a gloss counting task is designed to facilitate the holistic understanding of sign videos.

This method, however, assumes that the sound sources hardly move, and thus its performance is easily degraded by the source movements. In this paper, we solve this problem by introducing time-varying spatial covariance matrices and directions of arrival of sources into the nonlinear generative model of the neural FCA. This generative model is used for training a neural network to jointly separate and localize moving sources by using only multichannel mixture signals and array geometries. The training objective is derived as a lower bound on the log-marginal posterior probability in the framework of AVI.

To address this issue, we propose a Multimodal Contrastive Learning (MCL) method to make full use of video and audio information for violence detection. In specific, to avoid the video modality dominating the model training, we design a multi-encoder framework to perform task-driven feature encoding on video and audio respectively.

This letter presents a novel method using graph attention (GraphAC) for encoder-decoder based audio captioning. In the encoder, a graph attention module is introduced after the PANNs to learn contextual association (i.e. the dependency among the audio features over different time frames) through an adjacency graph, and a top-k mask is used to mitigate the interference from noisy nodes. The learnt contextual association leads to a more effective feature representation with feature node aggregation. As a result, the decoder can predict important semantic information about the acoustic scene and events based on the contextual associations learned from the audio signal.

It improves performance in many image classification tasks. Since its emergence, this pooling has seen two major improvements: Compact Bilinear Pooling (CBP) and square-root normalization. Recently, the combination of these two elements has been widely studied. However, due to the lack of good normalization solutions, existing combination approaches showed less efficiency when they are plugged into different networks and less compatibility when they work with existing CBP techniques. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose to apply Newton iterations, a fast square-root normalization method, to produce a new normalized matrix called pseudo square-rooted matrix. Subsequently, the new matrix allows a CBP technique to encode itself into a compact and normalized bilinear representation. In order to further accelerate the normalization process, our approach has two variants which can handle feature matrix extracted by different networks.

To account for this problem, we reformulate NR-IQA learning as an ordinal regression problem and propose a simple yet effective framework using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) and Transformers.

The former method does not offer any guarantee to match the estimated phase response at given points, whereas the latter one matches the phases at the input points, but is sensitive to the numerical precision of the specified group delays. In this work, we present a unimodular interpolation-based method to obtain all-pass filter coefficients that match the desired phase response at the given points without the need for group delays at the interpolating points. Through detailed simulations, we show that the proposed method is more suited for obtaining all-pass filters that match the target phases when compared to earlier approaches.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3267400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10102482","All-pass filter;blaschke product;unimodular interpolation","Interpolation;Delays;Poles and zeros;Signal processing algorithms;Numerical models;Matched filters;Finite impulse response filters","","3","","11","IEEE","14 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to address these problems, an improved shift graph convolutional network (Ishift-GCN) is proposed in this letter. The Ishift-GCN consists of two parts including a bidirectional spatial shift graph convolution with a dynamic mask, and a multi-scale temporal shift graph convolution. The bidirectional spatial shift graph convolution exploits more spatial information among joints, and the dynamic mask with stronger generalization ability can learn different correlations among features of different joints for different actions. The multi-scale temporal shift graph convolution captures more temporal information by complementing the shifted features with multi-scale convolution. Furthermore, knowledge distillation is used to reduce computational complexity. Compared with Shift-GCN, the proposed Ishift-GCN achieves better results with less computation complexity on two widely used benchmarks, namely the NTU-RGB+D and UAV-Human dataset.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3267975","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFE0203900); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62001429,62101512,62271290); Fundamental Research Program of Shanxi Province(grant numbers:20210302124031,201901D211247); Natural Science Foundation of North University of China(grant numbers:XJJ201904); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10104056","Action recognition;shift-GCN;skeleton","Convolution;Skeleton;Computational complexity;Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks;Kernel;Correlation","","9","","40","IEEE","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Generally, NA for KWS is required to have low parameter and computation complexity maintaining high classification performance. Most of the attempts so far have been based on manual approaches, and often the architectures developed from such efforts dwell in the balance of the performance and the network complexity. Then, several KWS models based on Neural Architecture Search (NAS) technique have been proposed. However, these methods do not consider the number of parameters and FLOPs for NA in the search process and manually adjusted the complexity of NA by reducing the number of cells. It may not produce optimized NA with a balance between network complexity and performance. To develop effective network architecture for KWS, network complexity and performance must be considered.

CSNAS selects whether each channel of the input feature is reflected in the computation or not in the search process and simultaneously controls the number of parameters, FLOPs, and performance.

The existing methods generate faces directly from eyes without considering the possibly available facial information (e.g. facial attributes), resulting in inaccurate predictions and high uncertainty in those features less correlated with eyes (e.g. hairstyle, moustache, facial contour).

In practice, such prediction may overestimate or underestimate the amount of URLLC data to be generated, yielding either an excessive or an insufficient amount of resources to be pre-emptively allocated for URLLC packets. In this letter, we introduce a novel scheduler for URLLC packets that provides formal guarantees on reliability and latency irrespective of the quality of the URLLC traffic predictor.

During each iteration each encoder searches through several perturbation results and retain one of them to the next iteration. When the iterations ends, the historical optimal perturbation result with the least Frobenius norm is output as the precoding result.

This letter proposes a novel MLHG model to improve the robustness of sEMG-based hand gesture recognition. The model utilizes multiple labels to decode the sEMG signals from two different perspectives. In the first view, the sEMG signals are transformed into motion signals using the proposed FES-MSCNN (Feature Extraction of sEMG with Multiple Sub-CNN modules). Furthermore, a discriminator FEM-SAGE (Feature Extraction of Motion with graph SAmple and aggreGatE model) is employed to judge the authenticity of the generated motion data. The deep features of the motion signals are extracted using the FEM-SAGE model. In the second view, the deep features of the sEMG signals are extracted using the FES-MSCNN model. The extracted features of the sEMG signals and the generated motion signals are then fused for hand gesture recognition. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, a dataset containing sEMG signals and multiple labels from 12 subjects has been collected. The experimental results indicate that the MLHG model achieves an accuracy of $\bm {99.26\%}$ for within-session hand gesture recognition, $\bm {78.47\%}$ for cross-time, and $\bm {53.52\%}$ for cross-subject.

In most existing algorithms, the representation matrix is solved by norm-minimization, which commonly enforces the error matrix with nuclear norm or sparsity norm.

However, existing tensor-based SC methods largely depend on an ideal assumption, that the sparse measurements are regularly located on grids. However, this assumption is largely unrealistic since the RM is continuous in essence, and can be measured at arbitrary positions deviating from the pre-divided grids. This work addresses the problem of parametric SC from irregular off-grid samplings. The main idea is combining interpolation with the multi-linear rank-$(L,L,1)$ block-term tensor decomposition (LL1). The interpolation is first adopted to guarantee the uniqueness of LL1, under the guidance of the proposed sampling pattern theorem. Then, the power spectrum density (PSD) and spatial loss field (SLF) of each emitter can be smoothly estimated, and SC is completed via the aggregation model. For the whole procedure, the uncertainty derived from interpolation is grid-wisely specified, and imposed as a restriction. Simulations verified that the proposed method outperforms the baselines based on on-grid samplings in harsher environments.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3257723","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62131005,62071096,62001089,U19B2014); Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:2022NSFSC0495); Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2021YJ0098); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10073602","Spectrum cartography;tensor decomposition;tensor completion;radio map","Tensors;Interpolation;Uncertainty;Spatial resolution;Frequency measurement;Sparse matrices;Slabs","","13","","16","IEEE","16 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

NSM at the coprime position (CP-NSM) is a measurement principle in two-dimensional (2D) acoustic imaging, wherein a planar array is moved to a coprime position for measurements. However, there are certain drawbacks to the measurement principles of spherical arrays in three-dimensional (3D) acoustic imaging. A measurement principle of 3D acoustic imaging has been investigated using 3D Non-Synchronous Measurements with a Central Reference based on Revolution and Autorotation (CR-NSM). The primary contributions of this CR-NSM are as follows: (1) A measurement principle for 3D non-synchronous measurements with a central reference based on revolution and autorotation is proposed. (2) The spatial resolution is primarily determined by the revolution in CR-NSM, and the side lobe is reduced by autorotation in CR-NSM. In the simulation results, the spatial resolution is obtained using CR-NSM for good imaging at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Moreover, the cross-spectral matrix (CSM) completion error is enhanced by adding the phase relations between consecutive positions.

It can not only alleviate the small sample size (SSS) problem but also make it full of structural information. However, 2DLDA behaves badly when processing the data with noise and outliers since it employs squared F-norm as the distance metric. Considering T$\ell _{1}$-norm is bounded and Lipschitz-continuous, we combine T$\ell _{1}$-norm with 2DLDA to overcome this problem and propose a novel method, named 2DLDA-T$\ell _{1}$. As far as we know, this is the first time to introduce T$\ell _{1}$-norm into 2DLDA. Since 2DLDA-T$\ell _{1}$ is a non-convex and non-smooth optimization model, it is difficult to solve. So, we design a spherical gradient ascent method, which can guarantee the unit constraint and the convergence of the objective function. Due to the boundedness and Lipschitz-continuity of T$\ell _{1}$-norm, it can be expected that 2DLDA-T$\ell _{1}$ should have better performance than the existing related methods, including 2DLDA, $\ell _{1}$-2DLDA, $\ell _{p}$-2DLDA, F2DLDA, and 2DBLDA.

To mitigate this issue and efficiently produce high-quality steganographic texts (stegotexts), we present a Progressive Non-autoregressive Generative linguistic Steganography (PNG-Stega), which encodes secret messages and extends the context to generate stegotexts in a multi-round insertion manner. Each round continuously refines the generated steganographic sequences on the premise of the global information of the previous round, while striving to decline the adverse effects of steganographic encoding on text quality. Moreover, for enhancing the semantic internal dependency of stegotexts, we utilize a constraint word sequences extraction scheme to obtain keywords to initialize the skeleton of targeted stegotexts, then expand the existing keywords with insertion operations. Experimental results demonstrate that PNG-Stega outperforms compared methods in terms of imperceptibility and anti-steganalysis ability.

We propose a novel accent conversion framework without the need for either parallel data or reference speech. Specifically, a text-to-speech (TTS) system is first pretrained with target-accented speech data. This TTS model and its hidden representations are expected to be associated only with the target accent. Then, a speech encoder is trained to convert the accent of the speech under the supervision of the pretrained TTS model. In doing so, the source-accented speech and its corresponding transcription are forwarded to the speech encoder and the pretrained TTS, respectively. The output of the speech encoder is optimized to be the same as the text embedding in the TTS system. At run-time, the speech encoder is combined with the pretrained speech decoder to convert the source-accented speech toward the target. In the experiments, we converted English with two source accents (Chinese/Indian) to the target accent (American/British/Canadian). Both objective metrics and subjective listening tests successfully validate that the proposed approach generates speech samples that are close to the target accent with high speech quality.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3270079","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62271432); Human-Robot Collaborative AI for Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering(grant numbers:A18A2b0046); Agency for Science, Technology and Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10107770","Accent conversion (AC);text-to-speech (TTS)","Acoustics;Training;Decoding;Feature extraction;Data models;Phonetics;Error analysis","","7","","35","CCBY","25 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The optimization framework is based on making the power of weight error vector undergo the steepest attenuation. Under the premise of maintaining the same evolutionary trend for time-varying step-size and kernel width, we formulate a constrained parameter optimization problem, where the step-size is subject to a kernel width induced constraint. By taking this approach, the original bivariate optimization can be transformed into a univariate optimization problem, which facilitates optimization solving. We further develop an existing reset scheme to make it suitable for kernel width to ensure a good tracking capability. In addition, we investigate the convergence behavior of the optimized algorithm.

The standard remedy is cycle spinning, which results in a substantial reduction of these artifacts. In this letter, we propose a theoretical investigation of the sparsity of solutions to the cycle-spinning variant of wavelet-based resolutions of linear inverse problems. We derive a representer theorem that provides a complete characterization of the solution set. Our theorem indicates that the solutions are typically not sparse, where sparsity is measured with respect to the wavelet dictionary.

In particular, a binary hypothesis test is formulated for discrimination, where the $H_{1}$ hypothesis contains the true target, while the $H_{0}$ hypothesis contains the unknown mainlobe jammer. The mainlobe jammer can be formulated as either a known subspace model or an unknown rank-one model. The former leads to a subspace-based selective detector (SSD) and the latter generates a rank-one-based SD (ROSD). Then, the formulated tests are handled using the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) criterion. At the analysis stage, the selectivity and detection performance are compared with the conventional GLRT and selective receivers.

However, the quadratic computational complexity caused by the self-attention mechanism is time-consuming and expensive. Meanwhile, the image resizing in the feature extraction stage loses the full-size image quality. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight attention mechanism using decomposed large-kernel convolutions to extract multiscale features, and a novel feature enhancement module to simulate HVS.

Under this constraint, the column vector of high-dimensional observed signals would be distributed in a specific subspace. According to the representation relation in time-frequency (TF) domain, each column vector of observed signal is uniquely clustered into the subspace, to which it belongs. Furthermore, the estimation of source signals is calculated by the inverse matrix or the pseudo-inverse matrix of the mixing matrix.

Based on the sparse common support property of the FRI samples, the denoising problem of the RD signals was modeled as an atomic norm soft thresholding problem, which jointly used multiple measurement vectors and could be unfolded into a model-driven deep network. The trainability and generalization ability of the network were improved by introducing piecewise linear functions and new trainable variables. By introducing an NL estimation operator, the NL could be better estimated during denoising, and the network training and convergence better supported. Additionally, the plug-and-play method could be used to complete denoising prior to many existing FRI methods.

However, previous studies on INRs have only focused on recovering original representations. This letter investigated an image compression model based on INRs using a model compression technique for entropy-constrained neural networks. Specifically, the proposed model trains a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to overfit a single image and then uses its weights to optimize its compressed representation using additive uniform noise. Accordingly, the proposed model efficiently minimizes the size of the model weight in an end-to-end manner. This training optimization process is fairly desirable for adjusting the rate of distortion for image compression. In contrast to other model compression techniques, the proposed model is implemented without additional training process or memory cost.

However, these methods are not robust due to the limited representation of statistical characteristics for non-Gaussian distributions and thus fail in domain matching. In addition, they often focus on matching distributions while not considering class decision boundaries between domains. To address these issues, we propose a novel Two-Stage Alignments Framework (TSAF) for UAD, which not only performs arbitrary-order moment matching to approximately characterize complex non-Gaussian distributions, but also utilizes domain-specific decision boundaries to align the probabilistic outputs of classifiers. Moreover, the reconstruction-based task is introduced to enhance the representation of the inherent characteristics for specific distribution.

Current methods typically employ multiple well-designed modules or rely on edge cues to learn object feature representations for COD. However, these methods still struggle to capture the discriminative semantics between camouflaged objects (foreground) and background, possibly generating blurry prediction maps. To address these limitations, we propose a novel mask-and-edge co-guided separable network (MECS-Net) for COD that leverages both edge and mask cues to learn more discriminative representations and improve detection performance.

A well-known problem with the Tucker model is that its number of entries increases exponentially with its order, a phenomenon known as the “curse of the dimensionality”. The Higher-Order Orthogonal Iteration (HOOI) and Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) are known as the gold standard for computing the range span of the factor matrices of a Tucker Decomposition but also suffer from the curse. In this letter, we propose a new methodology with a similar estimation accuracy as the HOSVD with non-exploding computational and storage costs. If the noise-free data follows a Tucker decomposition, the corresponding Tensor Train (TT) decomposition takes a remarkable specific structure. More precisely, we prove that for a $Q$-order Tucker tensor, the corresponding TT decomposition is constituted by $Q-3$ 3-order TT-core tensors that follow a Constrained Canonical Polyadic Decomposition. Using this new formulation and the coupling property between neighboring TT-cores, we propose a JIRAFE-type scheme for the Tucker decomposition, called TRIDENT.

Existing methods of event-based SLR rely on a uniform sampling strategy, which may result in redundant and indiscriminate information being captured when segments are randomly sampled. In this letter, we propose an effective sampling strategy called Quantity-inspired Sampling (QISampling) that takes advantage of the quantity feature of event distribution to sample key segments containing more discriminative and remarkable motion features from a sign. These segments are then converted into frame-like representations, which serve as input to subsequent Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In addition, we introduce a synthetic event-based sign language dataset N-WLASL to the community. We apply our strategy to DNNs and conduct experiments on this synthetic dataset and another real-world dataset.

This letter proposes a novel face privacy protection scheme via virtual identity transformation, which guarantees strong privacy protection and high identifiability. We first solve a specific identity mask for the user, which ensures that the identity features extracted only from the user's faces can be approximated to the given virtual identity.

To address the above issues, in this letter, we propose QS-CAN, a Query-Specific embedding Co-Adaptation Network, which generates task- and query-specific embeddings by fusing inter-class and intra-class information. The core modules of QS-CAN are Inter-Class Adapter(Inter-A) and Intra-Class Adapter(Intra-A). The Inter-Class Adapter encodes the global relationship within the task, pushing the different categories away from each other. At the same time, the Intra-Class Adapter focuses on modeling the local relationship within each category, pulling the instances within a category closer.

Thumbnail-preserving encryption (TPE) is a newly proposed technology especially for balancing usability and privacy of images stored in clouds. The TPE-encrypted image does not reveal anything other than the thumbnail and size of the original one. Although many well-designed TPE schemes have been put forward, they almost all operate in the spatial domain and are not compatible with JPEG images. The only two schemes that can be applied in the frequency domain were proposed by Wright et al. and Marohn et al., but both of them have disadvantages and do not consider non-visual usability. In this letter, we propose a usability enhanced TPE scheme especially for JPEG images by utilizing reversible data hiding and image encryption in the frequency domain. We first transform the original image into the frequency domain and select some specific locations for extra information recording in every block. The original coefficient values at the selected locations are then collected and embedded into the rest of the block before encryption. Finally, the extra information is expected to be recorded into the selected locations of every block for non-visual usability.

Specially, we design a novel adaptive weighting block in the MEFA-Net, which can adaptively assign weights to the enhanced features for each specific image, effectively improving the generalization ability of MEFA-Net. Second, we propose a feature aggregation sub-module (FAS) for comprehensive representation by integrating the features from different layers.

In this work, we propose a nonlinear graph filter that is an extension of the order one ARMA graph filter, to give the Median Autoregressive Graph Filter (MAF). The proposed MAF has a similar localization property to the linear counterpart, and can be implemented in a distributive manner.

To sum up, the DFDM should be deemed as intellectual property (IP) of the trainers, so it is crucial to protect IP. Currently, most watermarking-based IP protection schemes are implemented by introducing additional tasks, such as constructing trigger sets, fine-tuning model weights, etc., which severely impair the performance of the original task and increase the training cost. Inspired by the feature knowledge learned by the model, this letter proposes an IP protection (IPP) scheme for DFDM by verifying whether the suspect model contains the fingerprint ridge features learned by the victim model from another perspective based on the verifier. Firstly, the local binary pattern (LBP) is used to enhance the ridge texture on the fingerprint samples, so that DFDM can better learn the ridge features. Then, a DFDM lacking texture augmentation is employed as the adversarial model for training the meta-verifier without any alteration to the model parameters. Finally, the trained meta-verifier is used to determine whether the suspected model contains the ridge features in the victim model. The public fingerprint dataset (LivDet2017) was leveraged in the DFDM training process to validate our approach. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can verify the IP of DFDM and is robust to some common attacks.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3293471","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62102189,62122032); National Social Sciences Foundation of China(grant numbers:2022-SKJJ-C-082); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20200807,BK20200039); NUDT Scientific Research Program(grant numbers:JS21-4,ZK21-43); Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:KYCX23_1387); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10175609","Deepfake Fingerprint Detection;Intellectual Property Protection;Feature Knowledge;Model Watermarking;Model Stealing","Fingerprint recognition;Training;IP networks;Data models;Computational modeling;Task analysis;Intellectual property","","11","","21","IEEE","7 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By varying the order of a matrix geometric sum that approximates the inverse Jacobian matrix, root-finding at any iteration can be steered toward the FP or conversely toward the NR method, becoming identical to either of them if the order is equal to zero or infinitely large, respectively. Since the methods in this family do not need the solution of a linear system at each iteration as required by NR, their computational cost makes them palatable for the online digital implementation of nonlinear models.

However, most work has focused on long-only portfolios, and developing efficient algorithms with loose portfolio constraints remains a challenge. In this letter, the classical online portfolio selection problem is reformulated to allow long/short and margin. For this problem, conventional gradient-based online algorithms face the challenges of high regret and computational complexity due to non-optimal gradients and high-dimensional projections. To tackle this, we propose a novel online algorithm that introduces mirror descent to achieve dimension-free regret in a non-Euclidean space. Specifically, a Bregman divergence is introduced to replace the $\ell _{2}$ norm as a valid proximal setup for the problem to achieve uniform gradients and reduce projection computations. Furthermore, a smoothing technique is developed to reduce the variance of the gradients. The evaluation shows that our algorithm achieves low regret bound and computational complexity, which guarantees a 30% advantage over other strategies in Chinese futures market.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3296913","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62101048,62171030); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFC3301404); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2022M710394,2022T150053); Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST(grant numbers:2022QNRC001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10187676","Online portfolio selection;online learning;mirror decent algorithm;long-short market;future market","Portfolios;Signal processing algorithms;Computational complexity;Instruments;Mirrors;Convex functions;Transforms","","","","25","IEEE","19 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent studies have revealed that the beam alignment method can train a small-scale probing codebook that is customized to specific sites, and leverage the codebook measurements to determine the optimal transmit beam. However, existing approaches still necessitate a certain number of probing beams in order to achieve high-accuracy alignment. In this work, we propose a multi-task learning-based beam alignment method, leveraging channel reconstruction and contrastive representation as auxiliary tasks, to improve the primary task of joint probing codebook design and optimal beam selection. Specifically, we offer a channel reconstruction module that estimates the wireless channel with the probing measurements, to improve the channel sensing efficiency of the probing codebook.

However, there are several drawbacks to FME-LA (Kang et al., 2019). First, the weights of higher-order or complex systems cannot be learned because it only learns the output layer's weights. Second, it does not consider noise statistics, resulting in significant performance degradation in complex environments. Finally, it is not suitable for real-time implementation because the computation increases rapidly with the size of the moving window. To address these limitations, we propose the moving window iterative nonlinear system identification (MWI-NSID) scheme, which guarantees robustness and accuracy with a significant reduction in computation.

At each iteration, the proposed approach first utilizes the $\ell _{0}$-norm optimization theory to assign binary weights to all entries of the residual between the known and estimated matrices. With these binary weights, the optimization over the bilinear term is reduced to a weighted extension of the Frobenius norm. As a result, the optimization problem is decomposed into a group of row-wise and column-wise subproblems with closed-form solutions.

To enhance steganographic security, meanwhile addressing segmentation ambiguity, we propose a secure and disambiguating approach for linguistic steganography. In this letter, we focus on two questions: (1) Which candidate pools should be modified? (2) Which tokens should be retained? Firstly, we propose a secure token-selection principle that the sum of selected tokens' probabilities is positively correlated to statistical imperceptibility. To meet both disambiguation and optimal security, we present a lightweight disambiguating approach that is finding out a maximum weight independent set (MWIS) in one candidate graph only when candidate-level ambiguity occurs.

Existing speech backdoor attack methods typically utilize fixed and unnoticeable perturbations as triggers, but these may still be audible and thus detected during training and inference stages. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel backdoor attack paradigm (PhaseBack) injecting triggers in the phase spectrum. PhaseBack exhibits sufficient stealth by leveraging the fact that the human ear is insensitive to phase information. Besides, injecting partial perturbations in the frequency domain results in global perturbations throughout the time domain, making the attack more effective.

These results suggest that the apparent benefits of recurrence in CGP are context-dependent, and that selecting nodes from a uniform distribution is not always optimal.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3304198","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10214306","Audio synthesis;Cartesian genetic programming;digital signal processing;evolutionary algorithms","Synthesizers;Additives;Genetic programming;Oscillators;Feedback loop;Computer languages;Wheels","","1","","24","IEEE","10 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Among them, optimization-based methods (in particular, extensions of basis pursuit) allow us to design the representations through objective functions. Since acoustic signal processing utilizes models of spectrogram, the flexibility of optimization-based T-F representations is helpful for adjusting the representation for each application. However, acoustic applications often require models of magnitude of T-F representations obtained by discrete Gabor transform (DGT). Adjusting a T-F representation to such a magnitude model (e.g., smoothness of magnitude of DGT coefficients) results in a non-convex optimization problem that is difficult to solve. In this letter, instead of tackling difficult non-convex problems, we propose a convex optimization-based framework that realizes a T-F representation whose magnitude has characteristics specified by the user. We analyzed the properties of the proposed method and provide numerical examples of sparse T-F representations having, e.g., low-rank or smooth magnitude, which have not been realized before.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3303699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10214087","Sparse time-frequency analysis;basis pursuit;perspective function;convex optimization;primal-dual splitting","Manganese;Optimization;Spectrogram;Time-frequency analysis;Convex functions;Discrete cosine transforms;Signal processing algorithms","","2","","44","IEEE","9 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Deep learning-based face editing models can generate new parts but cannot achieve fine pixel-level manipulation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a two-step strategy for face deformation. We first generate a high-resolution intermediate image by blending the source image and the specific part of the target image via our face blending generative adversarial network (FB-GAN).

However, existing speech phase prediction methods are constrained to recovering phase spectra with short frame shifts, which are considerably smaller than the theoretical upper bound required for exact waveform reconstruction of short-time Fourier transform (STFT). To tackle this issue, we present a novel long-frame-shift neural speech phase prediction (LFS-NSPP) method which enables precise prediction of long-frame-shift phase spectra from long-frame-shift log amplitude spectra. The proposed method consists of three stages: interpolation, prediction and decimation. The short-frame-shift log amplitude spectra are first constructed from long-frame-shift ones through frequency-by-frequency interpolation to enhance the spectral continuity, and then employed to predict short-frame-shift phase spectra using an NSPP model, thereby compensating for interpolation errors. Ultimately, the long-frame-shift phase spectra are obtained from short-frame-shift ones through frame-by-frame decimation. Experimental results show that the proposed LFS-NSPP method can yield superior quality in predicting long-frame-shift phase spectra than the original NSPP model and other signal-processing-based phase estimation algorithms.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3305912","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:WK2100000033); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10223260","Error compensation;interpolation;neural network;spectral continuity;speech phase prediction","Interpolation;Signal processing algorithms;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Estimation;Training;Signal processing","","3","","23","IEEE","17 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, the DFB includes a feedforward mechanism and two feedback mechanisms: feature feedback (FF) and transmission feedback (TF). Specifically, the feedforward mechanism predicts a low-scale transmission map ($t$-map), while FF and TF aim to enhance confident features to reduce model uncertainty in the training process and correct features by introducing depth and density information. In addition, two novel modules: confident feature attention module (CFA) and transmission adjustment module (TADJ) are proposed as cores for confident features estimation of FF and TF, respectively.

However, such an approach encounters several issues: 1) the linguistic content contained in semantic tokens may get dispersed during multi-layer modeling while the lengthy speech input in the voice conversion task makes contextual learning even harder; 2) the semantic tokens still contain speaker-related information, which may be leaked to the target speech, lowering the target speaker similarity; 3) the generation diversity in the sampling of the LM can lead to unexpected outcomes during inference, leading to unnatural pronunciation and speech quality degradation. To mitigate these problems, we propose LM-VC, a two-stage language modeling approach that generates coarse acoustic tokens for recovering the source linguistic content and target speaker's timbre, and then reconstructs the fine for acoustic details as converted speech. Specifically, to enhance content preservation and facilitates better disentanglement, a masked prefix LM with a mask prediction strategy is used for coarse acoustic modeling. This model is encouraged to recover the masked content from the surrounding context and generate target speech based on the target speaker's utterance and corrupted semantic tokens. Besides, to further alleviate the sampling error in the generation, an external LM, which employs window attention to capture the local acoustic relations, is introduced to participate in the coarse acoustic modeling through shallow fusion. Finally, a prefix LM reconstructs fine acoustic tokens from the coarse and results in the converted speech. Experiments demonstrate that LM-VC outperforms competitive systems in speech naturalness and speaker similarity.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3308474","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2020AAA0108600); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10229308","Voice conversion;zero-shot;language modeling","Acoustics;Semantics;Linguistics;Context modeling;Timbre;Predictive models;Training","","15","","41","IEEE","24 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Conventional multi-source FH signal sorting is a two-stage scheme based on parameter estimation and signal classification, in which the low accuracy of parameter estimation will degrade signal sorting performance. Existing parameter estimation methods rely heavily on prior information about the signal and are susceptible to noise. This letter proposes a data-driven context-level FH signal parameter extractor (FHExt) to alleviate the mentioned limits by considering the correlations between pixels within signal areas and learning-based signal detection. To verify the sorting performance of the FHExt-based framework, an accurately labeled FH signal parameter extraction and sorting (FHES) dataset is developed.

CKSTN demonstrates the superiorities of the state-of-the-art methods in image-text retrieval on MSCOCO and Flickr30 K datasets.

When the number of speakers in the mixture is smaller than the number of outputs in the latter case, the extra outputs that are not mapped onto signals in the input mixture are trained to produce predefined target signals such as the silence or the input mixture. In this letter, we propose to ignore the extra outputs in training instead of evaluating the cost with a certain target for separation models with a fixed number of output channels.

In doing so, we establish an orthogonal binary two dimensional (2D) transform consisting of square wave basis functions. Typically, the 2D-HT is separated into a series of one dimensional (1D) transforms of the columns and rows of an image. This process yields binary, checkerboard pattern basis functions similar in appearance to the 2D separable discrete Hartley transform (SDHT). Instead, basis functions of our proposed non-separable 2D Hartley-Hadamard transform (HHT) are analogous to sinusoids of the non-separable 2D-discrete Hartley transform (DHT). This new transform closely mimics the 2D-DHT, while preserving the benefits and characteristics of the HT (such as being multiplication free). To our knowledge, this is the first non-separable 2D-HT, with the accompanying HST being the first to relate projections of the discrete Radon transform (DRT) to the 2D-HT of an image.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3311349","Faculty Grant from The University of Queensland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10238797","Hadamard transform;discrete Hartley transform;discrete Radon transform;discrete slice theorem;single pixel imaging;compressed sensing;binary DHT","Transforms;Discrete Fourier transforms;Radon;Discrete Hartley transforms;Complexity theory;Information technology;Image coding","","2","","42","IEEE","4 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Ground radar interferometric is an active space target positioning method, which can provide positioning information in all-weather and all-time. However, the directly measured interferometric phase will be ambiguous when the range difference between space targets and radar sites exceeds a certain boundary. In this letter, phase ambiguity resolution (AR) is established as a hidden Markov model (HMM) dynamic optimization problem in combination with the space target's movement process at different pulse times, in which no auxiliary baseline is required compared with traditional methods. And the Viterbi algorithm is used to solve the optimal ambiguous number (AN) sequence. Since the sequence decoding is mainly based on solving the optimal AN path that to explain the target position at different times best, a transmission technique of staggered carrier frequency signals is adopted, which significantly increases the robustness of phase AR.

However, multi-view data is often incomplete due to missing data in one or more random views. Therefore, several methods have been proposed for incomplete multi-view clustering to learn features that contain consensus information for clustering incomplete multi-view data (IMD). However, there is a part of the IMD that is not missing in any view, and most previous methods have not utilized this part to guide the process of learning consensus information. To address this issue, we design a knowledge distillation framework for incomplete multi-view clustering and propose an incomplete multi-view clustering with complete view guidance (IMC-CVG). We first train a robust teacher model with contrastive learning loss on the complete part of IMD to learn consensus features containing multi-view information. Then, we train a student model on all the IMD, where we mask partial views of the complete data to simulate missing data, and utilize the teacher model to guide the student model to learn consensus features that contain as much multi-view information as possible.

Specifically, the base station (BS) with multiple antennas delivers downlink data to multiple vehicles, respectively, and a sensing receiver simultaneously utilizes the downlink data signal to sense the motion of one vehicle. The sensing receiver is deployed separately. It collects the line-of-sight (LoS) signals from the BS and the scattered signals via the target vehicle, such that the distance and velocity of the target vehicle can be detected in a passive manner. As a result, the joint downlink beamforming and power optimization at the BS would be able to maximize the weighted summation of downlink data rates, subject to constraints on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) of the two signals for passive sensing. In order to solve the above non-convex optimization problem, we first derive the optimal receiving beams for the data and sensing receivers given arbitrary transmission beam design, and then propose a low-complexity iterative algorithm to find a sub-optimal design of transmission beams based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) method.

Besides, due to the unavailability of manually labeling the fine-grained sequential correspondence between audio-text pairs, we attempt to model ATR as a cooperative game process to flexibly handle the uncertainty during audio-text semantic interactions. Specifically, we treat audio frames and text words as players and present a game theoretic interaction (GTI) method to assess potential correspondence between audio frames and text words, which can also be seen as an additional learning signal to improve the pure audio-text contrastive learning. Furthermore, to implement multi-level WTA and GTI, we develop a token cluster module to cluster the frames/words and calculate the interaction scores between the clustered tokens. Experiments show that our WTA significantly improves the ATR performance on multiple datasets.

To tackle this deficiency, we propose adaptive weight loss (AWL), a function that assigns different weights to samples in accordance with their quality and difficulty based on our finding that speech quality is positively correlated with the L2 norm of speaker embedding. AWL directs the model's attention to high-quality difficult speech samples and ignores low-quality difficult samples as much as possible so that the model can learn well from speech data containing a lot of noise.

This may cause a crucial loss of information magnified by the fact that the region of interest is usually a tiny portion of the image. To overcome these limitations, we propose GROUSE, a novel and generalizable framework that produces salient features from medical images by grouping and selecting frequency sub-bands that provide approximations and fine-grained details useful for building a more complete input representation. The framework provides the most enlightening set of bands by learning their statistical dependency to avoid redundancy and by scoring their informativeness to provide meaningful data. This set of representative features can be fed as input to any neural model, replacing the conventional image input. Our method is task- and model-agnostic, thus it can be generalized to any medical image benchmark, as we extensively demonstrate with different tasks, datasets, and model domains. We show that the proposed framework enhances model performance in every test we conduct without requiring ad-hoc preprocessing or network adjustments.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3321554","Sapienza Università di Roma(grant numbers:RM120172AC5A564); PNRR MUR(grant numbers:PE0000013-FAIR); Regione Lazio(grant numbers:21027NP000000136); PNRR MUR(grant numbers:PNC1221852F49EDDD); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10268972","Generalizable deep learning;medical image analysis;mutual information;quaternion wavelet transform","Biomedical imaging;Quaternions;Wavelet transforms;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Discrete wavelet transforms;Mutual information","","4","","36","CCBY","2 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In real-world applications, one of the major technical challenges faced in PML is the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation of signals, and recent studies have turned to the concept of robust statistics to tackle such an issue. Continuing to delve into this research direction, here we address the discrepancy arising from the fact that the conventional robust statistical PML schemes inherently assume zero-centered error samples, which may not hold true when the positive NLOS biases are present. In contrast to the existing PML solutions, our proposal is based on the maximum correntropy criterion with variable center (MCC-VC), thereby taking into consideration the potential non-zero-centrality of error samples in the estimator derivation. Subsequently, we develop an alternating minimization algorithm to handle the nonconvex MCC-VC optimization problem in a way that can strike a fine balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

In light of this, we propose a novel Context Density Consistency Dynamic Time Warping (CDC-DTW) algorithm. It firstly designs local context windows adaptive to the lengths of time series. Then it proposed a local spatial-temporal context density consistency technique by down-sampling and interpolation compensating the high-frequency time series following the context density of low-frequency time series. Besides, a normalized Hamming window weighting function is embedded into the local contexts to create robust weighted cost measure.

To tackle these problems, we propose a novel framework called Mining Multi-view Clustering Space with Interpretable Space Search Constraint to explore the clustering structure while preserving the low-dimensional space semantic information. Our method maps samples from the raw space to a low-dimensional space separated into consensus and private features. This allows us to explore the interpretability of samples in the low-dimensional space to achieve representative representations. After assembling these representations, guided fusion is carried out and a search constraint is imposed to achieve a more reasonable clustering structure. Finally, by dynamically screening positive and negative samples, the clustering performance of the clustering space is maximized by contrastive learning.

A common practice is the integration of graph convolutional networks with recurrent neural networks. However, the discrete intervals of recurrent neural networks pose limitations on the temporal resolution of time series forecasting, impeding the model's ability to capture subtle changes in the data. To address this challenge, we introduce a continuous spatio-temporal framework, termed Graph Ordinary Differential Equation Recurrent Network (GODERN). GODERN incorporates continuous recurrent neural networks with a learnable and directed graph convolution layer to model the spatio-temporal dynamics in latent space. Furthermore, given the actual time representation in GODERN, we propose a novel augmented method of neural ordinary differential equation with fast-slow dynamics, thus allowing the encapsulation of multi-scale information.

Specifically, we propose a residual multi-scale Transformer group (RMTG), which consists of a local feature extraction module and a multi-scale Transformer block (MTB). RMTG is designed to capture the local information of features and model long-range dependencies. Within the MTB, the multi-scale cosine attention layer divides the input features into groups and further splits them into blocks of different sizes to enable fast cosine self-attention computation.

Recent years have seen deep learning (DL)-based SAD systems designed to improve robustness against static background noise and interfering speakers. However, SAD performance can be severely limited for conversations recorded in naturalistic environments due to dynamic acoustic scenarios and previously unseen non-speech artifacts. In this letter, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework designed to be robust to time-varying noise profiles observed in naturalistic audio. We develop a novel SAD solution for the UTDallas Fearless Steps Apollo corpus based on NASA's Apollo missions. The proposed system leverages spectro-temporal correlations with a threshold optimization mechanism to adjust to acoustic variabilities across multiple channels and missions. This system is trained and evaluated on the Fearless Steps Challenge (FSC) corpus (a subset of the Apollo corpus). Experimental results indicate a high degree of adaptability to out-of-domain data, achieving a relative Detection Cost Function (DCF) performance improvement of over 50% compared to the previous FSC baselines and state-of-the-art (SOTA) SAD systems. The proposed model also outperforms the most recent DL-based SOTA systems from FSC Phase-4.

Specifically, a hierarchical crossmodal interaction module in RMSF exploits potential complementary semantics among modalities via coarse- and fine-grained crossmodal attention. Furthermore, we design an adaptive feature refinement module to enhance the beneficial semantics of modalities and filter redundant features.

Our full model includes a shared feature extraction network, followed by several attribute-specific prediction branches. In each branch, we use the corresponding semantic mask, to select features from the associated region, for attribute prediction. Such explicitly semantic guidance (ESG) reduces the learning space, and thus alleviates the problems of limited data and imbalanced distribution.

The advantages of TRD lie in its ability to flexibly establish a connection between adjacent two factors in a higher order tensor. To effectively utilize TRD, it is necessary to have a high-order tensor with real-value factors. Initially, an eight-dimensional (8D) tensor was derived through the delay cross-covariance tensor. Then, by employing tensor permutation and the generalized tensorization of the 8D tensor, a four-dimensional (4D) tensor with factor matrices containing the difference coarray of transmit and receive arrays was obtained. Subsequently, four unitary matrices were applied to perform real-valued processing on the constructed 4D tensor factor matrix. The TRSVD algorithm was then used to estimate the three-dimensional (3D) TR core tensors of the 4D real-valued tensor.

In the BDQCD problem, dealing with compromised meters also becomes a challenge since these meters can collaboratively form an attack to lengthen the detection delay in an IoT network. Here we consider the network where a fusion center monitors the occurrence of an abrupt event through a bunch of distributed meters that may be compromised. To solve the challenge, a new coded framework for BDQCD utilizing bounded distance decoding at the fusion center is proposed. First, under sufficient meter-to-fusion-center link capacity, we achieve a theoretical result that the detection delay of our scheme can be asymptotically optimal in special cases.

Multi-view clustering based on deep auto-encoder can effectively capture the nonlinear features of high-dimensional data. However, the existing methods still have the following problems: 1) most autoencoder-based deep multi-view clustering methods ignore the differences between cross-view data and lose view-diversity features by using the same encoder structure for different views, and 2) many current deep multi-view techniques rely on single-lane neural networks for extracting feature data from each view. The current approach has limitations in its capability to accurately analyze comprehensive complementary information and multilevel features. To address these issues, we introduce a new clustering method Architecture Alternative Deep Multi-view Clustering (AADMC). Specifically, AADMC proposes a dynamic encoder network to adapt the encoder structure of each view according to the diversities of different views. Subsequently, AADMC proposes utilizing the Hilbert-Schmidt Independent Criterion (HSIC) to analyze the diversity of information between each encoder output.

Based on recent advance regarding knowledge distillation by applying masks, we also design a masked distillation module to screen out effective information from teacher's features to achieve more efficient knowledge distillation effect.

This estimator, called measure-transformed LSE (MT-LSE), operates by applying a transform to the joint probability measure associated with reshaped versions of the input-target training data pairs. The considered transform is generated by a non-negative function, called MT-function, that weights the data points. We show that proper selection of the MT-function substantially improves the estimation accuracy in the presence of impulsive noise, while maintaining the implementation simplicity of the standard LSE.

For simplicity, we assume a 2-D localization scenario, where each range measurement defines a circle, and measurements from different sensors create intersection points on the plane. The problem is to identify intersections that are created by LOS paths. To solve the problem, we classify the intersections into $N(N-1)/2$ types, where $N$ denotes the number of sensors.

The Conformer block leverages a self-attention mechanism to capture global information, along with a convolutional neural network to capture local information, resulting in improved performance. However, the Conformer-based model encounters an issue with the self-attention mechanism, as computational complexity grows quadratically with the length of the input sequence. Inspired by previous Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) guided blank skipping during decoding, we introduce intermediate CTC outputs as guidance into the downsampling procedure of the Conformer encoder. We define the frame with non-blank output as key frame. Specifically, we introduce the key frame-based self-attention (KFSA) mechanism, a novel method to reduce the computation of the self-attention mechanism using key frames. The structure of our proposed approach comprises two encoders. Following the initial encoder, we introduce an intermediate CTC loss function to compute the label frame, enabling us to extract the key frames and blank frames for KFSA. Furthermore, we introduce the key frame-based downsampling (KFDS) mechanism to operate on high-dimensional acoustic features directly and drop the frames corresponding to blank labels, which results in new acoustic feature sequences as input to the second encoder. By using the proposed method, which achieves comparable or higher performance than vanilla Conformer and other similar work such as Efficient Conformer.

In this letter, we propose a novel two-stage strategy for multipolar source reconstruction from sub-sampled sparse data that takes advantage of the sparsity of the sources in the physical domain. The data at the Nyquist sampling rate is recovered from sub-sampled data and then a conventional inversion algorithm is used to reconstruct sources. The data recovery problem is linked to a spectrum recovery problem for the signal with the finite rate of innovations (FIR) that is solved using an annihilating filter-based structured Hankel matrix completion approach (ALOHA). For an accurate reconstruction, a Fourier inversion algorithm is used. The suitability of the approach is supported by experiments.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3330130","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11971133); Saudi Data and AI Authority; King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals; SDAIA-KFUPM Joint Research Center for Artificial Intelligence(grant numbers:JRC-AI-RFP-16); Nazarbayev University, Kazakhstan; Faculty Development Competitive Research Grant Program(grant numbers:1022021FD2914); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10309168","Annihilating filter-based structured Hankel matrix completion approach (ALOHA);compressed sensing;inverse source problem;multipolar source;sparse data imaging","Image reconstruction;Imaging;Acoustics;Signal processing algorithms;Technological innovation;Sparse matrices;Signal to noise ratio","","","","28","IEEE","6 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This lack of data can be a significant challenge, making achieving accurate and reliable results difficult. We used Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to develop a novel technique for generating a footstep-based seismic signal of a person. In this letter, we have addressed two challenges. The first one involves generating synthetic footstep signals that closely mimic the significant statistical properties of an individual's footstep signal.

To overcome the first challenge, we have developed a Wasserstein distance-based One-Dimensional Generative Adversarial Network(1DGAN) with gradient penalty, to generate synthetic footstep data of a person. To address the second challenge we formulated a screening process based on statistical error metrics. Our experimentation on ten people achieved an overall test identification accuracy of 98.44%.

Therefore, we propose a pairwise attentive adversarial network with a Domain Mixup (DomMix) module to mitigate the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, a deep-level mixup is employed to construct an intermediate domain that allows features from both domains to share their differences. Then a pairwise attentive adversarial network is applied with attentive encoding on both image-level and instance-level features at different scales and optimizes domain alignment by adversarial learning. This allows the network to focus on regions with disparate contextual information and learn their similarities between different domains.

Nevertheless, this method can introduce uncertain frequency variations that reduce the effectiveness of the attacks. We propose a method for Frequency-Domain Backdoor Attacks in response. The method utilizes Fourier Decomposition and Fundamental Frequency Injection techniques. In our method, we employ Fourier decomposition to mask the fundamental frequency of unsuitable bands, thereby guaranteeing covert trigger injection. As a result, this technique enhances temporal and spectral camouflaging, considerably reducing the likelihood of discovery.

In this letter, a novel steganalysis detector called GFS-Net is proposed, aiming at enhancing the stego signal as much as possible while balancing the three metrics to obtain comprehensive detection performance. In preprocessing, combining highly lightweight gated channel transformation with a pointwise convolution layer used for enlarging the number of channels enriches the expression of the stego signal by promoting cooperation among enlarged channels, thereby significantly improving the signal-to-noise ratio while avoiding occupying a large NP. Moreover, two FasterNet blocks equipped with partial convolution having a small NP, rather than residual blocks, are applied to the last two layers of feature extraction to efficiently extract the stego signal by reducing the calculation of similar features, so that the computational cost and NP are saved. Finally, compared to using the global average pooling (GAP) alone, the stylepooling jointly utilizing the global standard deviation pooling and GAP helps the subsequent fully connected better identify weak stego signal, and thus improves detection accuracy. By means of the above three perspectives, GFS-Net with only 0.13 M parameters is obtained.

Particularly in the context of differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP), where learned parameters may explicitly control the frequency of synthesis components, the MSS loss often fails to provide informative gradients. The main goal of this letter is to gain a better understanding of how different configurations of the MSS loss affect this problem. As an illustrative example, we analyze the task of sinusoid frequency estimation via gradient descent to compare different configurations and their effect on the loss properties. Furthermore, we show that favorable configurations can also facilitate unsupervised training of a more complex DDSP additive synthesis autoencoder.

However, the differences of scale and orientation are unavoidable when obtaining useful information from the Ref image. In addition, it is difficult to achieve a good match due to the ill-posed between the LR image and Ref image. To address these challenges, we propose a new matching module, named progressive spatial adaptation module (PSAM).

However, most of them simply take the speech data from a subject participating in a task (e.g., picture description) as a whole audio sequence, and lack considerations on separate utterances that may be related to different topics in the picture and are of different importance for discriminating AD patients from healthy controls. To this end, this letter proposes an AD detection method with topic modeling for utterances composed of audio words. First, an audio word discovery algorithm using Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) is designed to tokenize speech data without relying on text transcriptions. Then, a topic model is built that assigns each utterance a topic label in an unsupervised way. Finally, an Audio-Word HuBERT (AW-HuBERT) model integrating utterance-level topic labels is constructed for AD detection. This model is pretrained by training the existing HuBERT model with audio word sequences. The final decision for a recording is made by the weighted sum of utterance-level classification possibilities, and topic-dependent Area-Under-Curve (AUC) values are used as the weights. Experimental results on the DementiaBank dataset show that the proposed method achieves a better AD detection accuracy than state-of-the-art methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3334696","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10323509","Speech processing;natural language processing;deep learning;Alzheimer's disease","Task analysis;Signal processing algorithms;Data models;Vocabulary;Training data;Speech coding;Feature extraction","","2","","35","IEEE","20 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A recent trend in CPD research is to replace the traditional statistical tests with distribution-free autoencoder-based algorithms, which can automatically learn complex patterns in time series data. In particular, the so-called time-invariant representation (TIRE) models have gained traction, as these separately encode time-variant and time-invariant subfeatures, as opposed to traditional autoencoders. However, optimizing the trade-off between two loss terms, i.e., the reconstruction loss and the time-invariant loss, is challenging. To address this issue, we propose a novel loss function that elegantly combines both losses without the need for manually tuning a trade-off hyperparameter. We demonstrate that this new hyperparameter-free loss, in combination with a relatively simple convolutional neural network (CNN), consistently achieves superior or comparable performance compared to the manually-tuned baseline TIRE models across diverse benchmark datasets, both simulated and real-life. In addition, we present a representation analysis, demonstrating that the distribution of the time-invariant features extracted by our model is more concentrated within the same segment (more so than with previous TIRE models), which implies that these features can potentially be used for other applications, such as classification and clustering.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3336258","Flemish Government; AI Research Program; European Research Council; European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme(grant numbers:802895); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10328048","Autoencoder;change point detection;time-invariant representation (TIRE);unsupervised learning","TV;Tires;Feature extraction;Diamonds;Time series analysis;Decoding;Windows","","5","","18","IEEE","23 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

CPG-LS constructs a causal perception network by making full use of a trained CNN discriminator to assess the security of each original word in the cover text and its substitutable candidates for controlling the embedding of secret message. Particularly, the causal score of each word is comprehensively measured from two perspectives by the causal perception network, one is word saliency, and the other is anti-steganalysis capability. Finally, the selection of original words is explicitly guided by their causal scores for securely embedding secret message. As the causal score of a word decreases, the perturbation caused by modifying this word becomes smaller, leading to stronger anti-steganalysis capability and lower semantic distortion in the obtained stegotexts.

In comparison to simply exploiting DDAC as preprocessing, DDAC + the residual structure can better improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the residual maps by suppressing the image content. In addition, CSPP-SID is innovatively proposed to convert feature maps of any size into feature vectors with fixed dimension, helping SwT-SN achieving high detection accuracy for arbitrary-sized images. Finally, a two-part structure of SwT with a fixed number of patches is firstly designed for image steganalysis to greatly reduce training cost by calculating the multi-head self-attention mechanism in the shifted window. Extensive experiments on two benckmark databases verify that SwT-SN has higher detection accuracy and shorter training cost compared to two prior state-of-the-art networks.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3336561","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62262062,61571139,61872128); Fujian Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:2020J06043); Beijing Municipal Education Commission Project(grant numbers:KM202110015004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10328705","CSPP-SID;deep learning;steganalysis;SwT-SN","Feature extraction;Training;Convolution;Steganography;Signal to noise ratio;Payloads;Costs","","6","","31","IEEE","24 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, we proposed a novel cluster contrastive learning method (CLCO) for few-shot learning (even one-shot learning) and cross-domain fault diagnosis under complex fault modes, fault severities, and variable working conditions. The proposed CLCO combines clustering strategy and contrastive learning to learn discriminate domain invariant feature representation. Moreover, the consistency in the characteristic distribution of data is viewed as the pseudo label information captured by k-means clustering, which are subsequently embedded into strengthen contrastive loss (SCL) function of proposed CLCO model. Then, the pseudo label information is exploited to guide self-supervised contrastive pre-training for learning domain invariant features based on feature similarity comparison of positive and negative pairs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed CLCO outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3336564","National Key Research and Development Program of China Key Special Project(grant numbers:2018YFB1700702); Key Research and Development Projects of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:2022YFG0246,2022ZDZX0001,2023YFN0027,2021YFS0021); 2022 Dazhou Cooperation Project of Sichuan University(grant numbers:2022CDDZ-06); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10328714","Intelligence fault diagnosis;self-supervised learning;clustering","Feature extraction;Fault diagnosis;Training;Deep learning;Data mining;Convolution;Vibrations","","4","","35","IEEE","24 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, general methods are targeted at pinhole images and tend to underperform when directly adopted to panoramic images. And with the wide applications of panoramic cameras, it is important to develop feasible approaches to train segmentation models for their real-time applications. To address this problem, we propose a novel method using self-training and achieve comparable results on DensePASS dataset. Namely, we propose a deformable merge module tailored for panoramic images by efficiently and accurately incorporating features of different levels. We design a novel prototype adaptation term that aids the model to better learn the class-wise feature embeddings of distorted objects. Finally, we use a simple and valid evaluation method to achieve real-time and improved inference performance.

"A Low Complexity Estimator of Hyperbolic Frequency Modulated Signals","X. Xu; X.

A novel approximation expression for the spectrum of HFM signals is derived. It surpasses the conventional approximation formula in terms of accuracy and reveals that phase parameters determine the amplitude spectrum peak of the HFM signal. Consequently, by using this characteristic, we can directly obtain coarse parameter estimation by locating the peak of the amplitude spectrum. The result is then refined to approach the Cramér-Rao lower bound. Since the proposed method eliminates the grid search process required by many existing estimators, it reduces computational complexity. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method has a signal-to-noise-ratio threshold that is only 2 dB worse than the state-of-the-art method, but it is the least expensive to compute.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3338057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10336392","Amplitude spectrum;parameter estimation;hyperbolic frequency modulated signals","Frequency modulation;Frequency estimation;Fourier transforms;Signal to noise ratio;Signal processing algorithms;Indexes;Fresnel reflection","","","","26","IEEE","30 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It first represents the spatial sparsity of incoming signals as the row sparsity of a power-scaled polarization matrix, which arises from the matrization of the redundancy-reduced covariance vector. Then the row sparsity issue is relaxed to an $\ell _{2,1}$ norm minimization form and solved in a gridless way via a compact formulation, where a dimension reduction method is introduced to reduce the problem size. Compared to existing techniques, the proposed method processes the polarization information holistically and derives each signal parameter in the continuous domain.
