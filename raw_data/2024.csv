Decoding Silent Reading EEG Signals Using Adaptive Feature Graph Convolutional Network,C. Li; G. Fang; Y. Liu; J. Liu; L. Song,"Academy for Engineering & Technology, Fudan Univerisity, Shanghai, China; Academy for Engineering & Technology, Fudan Univerisity, Shanghai, China; Academy for Engineering & Technology, Fudan Univerisity, Shanghai, China; Academy for Engineering & Technology, Fudan Univerisity, Shanghai, China; Academy for Engineering & Technology, Fudan Univerisity, Shanghai, China",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,3 Jan 2024,2024,31,,1,5,"Decoding silent reading Electroencephalography (EEG) signals is challenging because of its low signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, EEG signals are typically non-Euclidean structured, therefore merely using a two-dimensional matrix to represent the variation of sampling points of each channel in time cannot richly represent the spatial connection between channels. Furthermore, due to the individual differences in EEG signals, a fixed representation cannot adequately represent the temporal and spatial associations between channels in real time. In this letter, we use the feature matrix and its adaptive graph structure to represent each EEG signal. Then, we use them as inputs and propose a novel Adaptive Feature Graph Convolutional Network (AFGCN) to decode the silent reading EEG signals. We classify silent reading EEG signals under different tasks of 16 subjects from two publicly available datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves higher decoding accuracy than state-of-the-art EEG classification networks on both datasets. Among them, the highest classification accuracy for the four classes is 83.33%. The study could promote the application and development of BCI technology for silent reading EEG signal decoding.

Nevertheless, these methods often suffer from time-consuming attributable to their sizable model dimensions. Moreover, they face challenges in adapting unknown scenes, primarily because the scattering model's original design was intended for atmospheric rather than marine condition. To address these obstacles, we begin by investigating the inherent differences in imaging characteristics between atmospheric and marine conditions based on statistical distributions. Building on these observations, we introduce an efficient and effective algorithm called Deep Scene Curve, abbreviated as DSC. This method comprises two essential steps: scene-irrelevant zero-mean adjustment and scene-oriented hyperparameter estimation. The first step transforms scene features into a unified zero-mean space, thereby reducing interference from scene-specific attributes. In the second step, we employ a lightweight neural network to estimate scene-oriented hyperparameters for a defined pixel-level curve based on underwater observations. This approach enables us to generate a deep curve that excels in both adaptability and efficiency, as substantiated by extensive experiments. Notably, our method achieves a significant 56% improvement in average inference time while reducing FLOPs by 92% compared to existing techniques. Furthermore, our extensive experiments in low-light image enhancement tasks highlight the potential advantages of DSC.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2023.3338055,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U22B2052,62027826); LiaoNing Revitalization Talents Program(grant numbers:2022RG04); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10336378,Deep learning;underwater image enhancement;curve estimation,Image color analysis;Training;Adaptation models;Image enhancement;Computational modeling;Atmospheric modeling;Estimation,,3,,37,IEEE,30 Nov 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

However, the quadratic complexity of MHSA and the inefficiency of non-parallelized window partition seriously affect the inference speed, hindering these SR methods from being applied to application scenarios requiring speed and quality. To address this issue, we propose an Asymmetric Large-kernel Attention Network (ALAN) utilizing a stage-to-block design paradigm inspired by ViT. In the ALAN, the core block named Asymmetric Large Kernel Convolution Block (ALKCB) adopts a similar structure to the Swin Transformer Layer but replaces the MHSA with our proposed Asymmetric Depth-Wise Convolution Attention (ADWCA) to enhance both the SR quality and inference speed. The proposed ADWCA, with linear complexity, uses large kernel depth-wise dilation convolution and Hadamard product as the attention map. The structural re-parameterization technique to strengthen the kernel skeletons with asymmetric convolution is also explored. Experimental results demonstrate that ALAN achieves state-of-the-art performance with faster inference speed than ViT-based models and smaller parameters than CNN-based models.

However, we find that exclusive usage of the two types of information is sub-optimal; whether the context-based approach is effective or the latent-based approach is effective is different for each missing region. To this end, we propose CoLaNet, a novel framework that adaptively blends context and latent information to inpaint face images.

Nevertheless, these methods rely on sufficient pixel-wise annotated data, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive to acquire in clinical practice. This challenge is further escalated under the polyp segmentation scenario due to the massive video frames. To alleviate annotating burden, in this letter, we propose a label-efficient polyp segmentation framework named HybridVPS, which drastically reduces the annotation cost while maintaining satisfactory performance. Our core insight is to take full advantage of the similar semantics between consecutive video frames. Specifically, only a few frames require pixel-wise annotations, while the cheap scribble annotations are enough for the remaining part. To fully leverage the coarse location information provided by scribble annotations, we introduce an adaptive label prompter, which utilizes pixel-wise annotation to provide reliable guidance for scribble-annotated neighboring frames, thus facilitating the overall accuracy of the segmentation. Extensive experiments on the large-scale video polyp dataset SUN-SEG demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

Several impressive text-guided image editing methods based on GANs and CLIP have emerged. However, in these studies, most of them simply minimize the distance between the target image embedding and text embedding in the CLIP space, and take this objective as network's optimization goal, overlooking the real distance between them may be large.

Therefore, we develop a novel adaptively optimized masking EMD (AOMEMD), a generalized, automated method to solve MMP.

However, the neuromorphic data consists of asynchronous event spikes, which makes it difficult to construct a big benchmark to train a power general neural network model, thus limiting the neuromorphic data understanding for “unseen” objects by deep learning. While for the frame image, since the training data can be obtained easily, the zero-shot and few-shot learning for “unseen” task via the large Contrastive Vision-Language Pre-training (CLIP) model, which is pre-trained by large-scale image-text pairs in 2D, have shown inspirational performance. We wonder whether the CLIP could be transferred to neuromorphic data recognition to handle the “unseen” problem. To this end, we materialize this idea with NeuroCLIP in the paper. The NeuroCLIP consists of 2D CLIP and two specially designed modules for neuromorphic data understanding. First, an event-frame module that could convert the event spikes to the sequential frame image with a simple discrimination strategy. Second, an inter-timestep adapter, which is a simple fine-tuned adapter based on a spiking neural network (SNN) for the sequential features coming from the visual encoder of CLIP to improve the few-shot performance.

In this letter, we propose a novel sentence-level Steganography framework to Hide Information in Syntax Space (HISS-Stega) that enables larger embedding capacity while preserving better semantic coherence. Specifically, HISS-Stega builds a syntax-controlled paraphrase generation model to automatically modify the expression forms of the covertext, thereby augmenting the diversity of transformations. This enhancement contributes to the overall improvement in embedding capacity. Subsequently, a syntactic bins coding strategy is employed for successfully embedding secret information in the generated syntax space. Furthermore, HISS-Stega incorporates a semantic distortion function aimed at identifying the optimal syntactic structure for concealing secret information, thereby ensuring enhanced semantic coherence and mitigating potential security risks.

However, PCCE has been mainly studied in the image domain. In this letter, we explore how PCCE can be applied to the video domain by revisiting the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control. The proposed method consists of three key components: 1) The proportional term determines a power-saving ratio for each video frame based on its luminance, resulting in aggressive power-saving in bright video frames; 2) the integral term ensures that the target power-saving ratio is achieved over the entire video; 3) the differential term prevents abrupt temporal fluctuations in the power-saving ratio of consecutive video frames.

However, GFANC solely relies on the information from the current noise frame to generate its control filter, resulting in potential inaccuracies when dealing with dynamic noises. Therefore, we propose a GFANC-Kalman approach that integrates an efficient one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) with a Kalman filter to further improve the performance of GFANC. Specifically, the weight vector used to combine sub control filters is predicted by the 1D CNN for each noise frame, and then processed by the Kalman filter with minimal complexity. By considering the correlation between adjacent noise frames, the Kalman filter can enhance the accuracy and robustness of weight vector prediction. Hence, GFANC-Kalman is more able to adapt to changes in noise distribution, particularly for dynamic noises.

To pursue this goal, a novel line segment detector, called the contrast-guided line segment detector (CGLSD), is proposed in this paper. Our basic idea is to integrate a low-level image attribute, i.e., edge contrast, into the line segment detection process for improving line continuity. After applying an edge detector to the input image, the edge contrast is exploited to guide the growth of a line-support region for each line segment individually. This is achieved by evaluating edge pixels as well as those non-edge pixels that are nearby the edges. As a result, some of the non-edge pixels are re-considered as ‘edge’ pixels and included for establishing the support region. Reversely, certain edge pixels might be treated as ‘non-edge’ pixels instead and excluded from the region. Since each support region is supposed to yield only one line segment, each formed support region needs to have a refinement by removing those edge pixels that do not belong to it. Lastly, the support region is required to pass through a validation check that might lead to a complete discard of the line segment due to its low confidence. Extensive experiments are conducted and compared with multiple state-of-the-arts on two datasets, including the one from us with manually-annotated ground truth.

Given a target prompt, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) are able to generate realistic yet eligible images. With this appealing property, the image translation task has the potential to be free from target image samples for supervision. By using a target text prompt for domain adaption, the diffusion model is able to implement zero-shot image-to-image translation advantageously. However, the sampling and inversion processes of DDPM are stochastic, and thus the inversion process often fail to reconstruct the input content. Specifically, the displacement effect will gradually accumulated during the diffusion and inversion processes, which led to the reconstructed results deviating from the source domain. To make reconstruction explicit, we propose a prompt redescription strategy to realize a mirror effect between the source and reconstructed image in the diffusion model (MirrorDiffusion). More specifically, a prompt redescription mechanism is investigated to align the text prompts with latent code at each time step of the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion to pursue a structure-preserving reconstruction.

In this letter we explore semantic AWE modelling. These AWEs should not only capture phonetics but also the meaning of a word (similar to textual word embeddings). We consider the scenario where we only have untranscribed speech in a target language. We introduce a number of strategies leveraging a pre-trained multilingual AWE model: a phonetic AWE model trained on labelled data from multiple languages excluding the target.

Recognizing that the energy radiated by the array cannot be locked at a fixed range and angle, the beampattern is designed for the equivalent beampattern at the receiving end, differing from the traditional emphasis on the transmit beampattern. The proposed scheme formulates the beampattern design as a minimization problem, where the cost function is defined as the squared error between the designed and the given beampatterns. The developed scheme is then implemented through an optimal selection of both the FDA frequency offsets and the receiver steering weights. To this end, an iterative algorithm with monotonic convergence is introduced to solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem involving a fourth-order polynomial objective function as well as multiple non-convex constraints.

These solutions tend to employ deep metric learning methods to enlarge inter-class distances while suppressing intra-class variations in the embedding space. However, a notable issue is that actions even from the same class may exhibit different characteristics since the individual differences among performers. Consequently, suppressing intra-class variations may hinder the model's ability to generalize to unseen classes. To alleviate this problem, we propose a spatial-temporal adaptive metric learning network. At its core, our method can learn a pair of sub-embeddings, one of which attends to the spatial information and one focuses on the temporal information, with the aim of increasing the diversity of embeddings and preserving the differences of intra-class. Moreover, to meet the varying degrees of spatial and temporal information requirements for different samples, an adaptive weight assignment module is designed for allocating attention weights to each sub-embedding.

However, it falls short of multi-channel SE due to the absence of spatial cues. These cues, present in multi-channel recordings, aid in distinguishing speech from noise more effectively. To bridge this gap, we introduce a method for mapping monaural speech into a fixed simulation space. Here, single-channel recordings are transformed into a predefined binaural format, enhancing the differentiation between target speech and noise components. This is achieved through knowledge distillation, enabling the monaural SE model to learn simulated binaural speech features from a pre-trained binaural SE model. It is important to note that we use a single type of binaural room impulse response and the monaural input of the student to simulate binaural speech. This way, our approach bypasses the paradox of generating virtual spatial information from monaural speech, while still benefiting from the spatial cues of binaural speech.

Neural radiance fields(NeRF) have demonstrated their excellent performance for image based photo-realistic free-viewpoint rendering. However, one limitation of current NeRF based methods is the shape-radiance ambiguity, which means that without any regularization, there may be an incorrect shape that explains the training set very well but that generalizes poorly to novel views.

Currently, graph-based methods like HGraph-CL achieve promising performance, which rely on two different levels of graph contrastive learning within and between modalities to explore sentiment correlations. However, HGraph-CL still faces the following drawbacks in graph construction: 1) nodes of the graph are represented at the frame level, only containing low-level information, neglecting the correlations among high-level semantics; 2) edges of the graph are based on the fixed dependency relations between words in the text sequence and the adjacent relations between frame-level nodes in the non-verbal sequences, failing to effectively capture implicit and long-distance correlations.

To tackle this issue, in this work, we introduce a computationally efficient adaptive filtering technique that is capable of resolving more sources than the number of sensors. The proposed adaptive algorithm utilizes the second-order statistics of the source signals captured by the coarray along with the least mean square (LMS) principle to perform U-DOA estimation. The coarray sensor at the zeroth location is used as a reference coarray sensor and the positive part of the coarray is used as an auxiliary coarray. The auxiliary coarray signal is passed through a linear filter and an error signal of the adaptive process is generated by subtracting the filter output from the reference coarray signal. The error is then minimized iteratively to obtain the final filter weights. The filter is then used to calculate a novel spatial spectrum whose peaks give the estimate of the DOAs.

The focus of existing studies in facial expression recognition remains primarily on classifying basic or single expressions, which limits its application to compound facial expression recognition. Moreover, some compound facial expression recognition methods rely on laboratory-controlled expression data, narrowing their generalizability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we carry out the task of compound facial expression recognition in unconstrained environments. To this end, we devise a new loss function, specifically for compound facial expression recognition, called bi-center loss, which is built upon center loss. Unlike center loss that considers all categories, bi-center loss enables deep neural networks to learn compound emotion features by leveraging basic emotion centers. Additionally, we introduce a basic-center regularization term, based on the variance among the basic centers, to ensure appropriate discriminative capabilities of the learned features.

The encoder-based NASR, e.g. connectionist temporal classification (CTC), can be initialized from the speech foundation models (SFM) but does not account for any dependencies among intermediate tokens. The encoder-decoder-based NASR, like CTC alignment-based single-step non-autoregressive transformer (CASS-NAT), can mitigate the dependency problem but is not able to efficiently integrate SFM. Inspired by the success of recent work of speech-text joint pre-training with a shared transformer encoder, we propose a new encoder-based NASR, UniEnc-CASSNAT, to combine the advantages of CTC and CASS-NAT.

As an alternative knowledge for few-shot learning, self-supervised learning can extract supervisory signals directly from unlabeled data. However, existing self-supervised few-shot methods which directly take the summation of two tasks, have two fundamental bottlenecks: 1) representation bias: how to extract efficacious supervisory signals in self-supervision and eliminate the disturbance of undesirable shortcuts with limited examples and 2) objective conflict: how to adaptively trade-off the self-supervision and supervision to achieve the optimal model performance. To address the above problems, in this paper, we propose a novel approach named ReInforced SElf-supervised training (RISE) for few-shot learning. RISE leverages agent-relative supervision to eliminate the undesirable shortcut learning of self-supervised training. Meanwhile, it dynamically explores the balance between supervisory signals from self-supervised tasks and inherent supervision from few-shot tasks to avoid the trade-off dilemma.

In this letter, we aim to bridge this gap by providing convergence analysis for training orthonormal deep linear neural networks. Specifically, we show that Riemannian gradient descent with an appropriate initialization converges at a linear rate for training orthonormal deep linear neural networks with a class of loss functions.

Unlike existing deep steganalysis networks, which simply minimize the domain discrepancy between source and target to address the problem of CSM, and thus, cannot handle large domain discrepancy, IDGM based on LFMP generates diverse intermediate domains to bridge the two extreme domains so as to alleviate the decrease in detection accuracy caused by CSM. Moreover, ISNet enables the intermediate domain distribution to progressively transit from source to target by adjusting the domain factor sampled from $Beta(\alpha,1)$, so that the classifier gradually adapted to target provides an improvement in discriminability on the target domain.

However, the extensive resource requirements during pre-training, instruction fine-tuning (IF), and reinforcement learning through human feedback (RLHF) pose challenges, particularly for individuals and studios with limited resources. Moreover, sensitive data that cannot be deployed on remote training platforms or queried through APIs further exacerbates this issue. To address these limitations, researchers have introduced a parameter-efficient framework called low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for IF on LLMs. However, training individual LoRA networks faces capacity constraints and struggles to adapt to large domains with significant distributional shifts across different tasks. In this letter, we propose a novel framework called chain-of-LoRA to enhance the IF performance of LoRA. Our approach involves training a LoRA network to classify the instruction type and then utilizing task-specific LoRA networks to accomplish the respective tasks. By training multiple task-specific LoRA networks, we exploit a trade-off between performance and disk storage, leveraging the easily expandable and cost-effective nature of disk storage compared to precious graphical resources.

In this paper, the flaws in the temporal consistency (TC) of speaker features inherent in the speech synthesis process are analyzed. Differences in the TC of intra-utterance speaker features arise due to limited control over speaker features during speech synthesis. The speech generated by text-to-speech algorithms exhibits higher TC, while the speech generated by voice conversion algorithms yields slightly lower TC compared to bonafide speech.

The adaptation of BAC breaks the limitation of scene diversity on compensation and reduces the dependence of the trained network on training patterns. Moreover, BAC is a perceptual enhancement method, that preserves the texture information of targets to ensure that enhanced results of BAC suit high-level visual tasks. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of underwater image enhancement with BAC show notable performance improvement against other compensation methods.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2024.3384940,"Hainan Provincial Joint Project of Sanya Yazhou Bay Science and Technology City(grant numbers:2021CXLH0001,2021JJLH0003); Key Research and Development Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China(grant numbers:2020YFC1512200); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10489946,Learning-based enhancement;physical-based compensation;underwater image enhancement,Image reconstruction;Attenuation;Semantics;Correlation;Image color analysis;Image enhancement;Optical imaging,,5,,27,IEEE,3 Apr 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Experimental results indicate that the radar jamming waveforms generated based on GAN Models can achieve transcendental jamming, increasing the difficulty of radar jamming signal recognition.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2024.3386491,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10494881,Generative adversarial network;intra-pulse jamming;jamming effect;transcendental jamming;waveform generation,Jamming;Radar;Generative adversarial networks;Generators;Reconnaissance;Relays;Training,,3,,18,CCBYNCND,8 Apr 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

The existing studies have confirmed the importance of learning part-wise representations for this task. We go a step further by proposing a two-stage learning framework. The first stage focuses on extracting part-wise representations. In the second stage, a novel Adaptive Embedding Network (AEN) integrates these representations into a global embedding of the entire image to avoid an equal influence of all local parts on image similarity measures. Current mainstream methods typically employ Cross-Entropy loss to learn location-dependent representations, aiming to push the distance between different locations in the learned representation space. Some approaches also utilize KL loss or Triplet loss to bring a pair of UAV-satellite images from the same location closer for learning view-invariant representations. However, they overlook a critical concern: a notable representation bias exists among UA-view images captured from the same location but at different viewpoints or heights. To address these issues, we devise a novel cross-view matching loss that narrows the distance between the global embeddings of a satellite-view image and the affinity-aware prototype of multiple true-matched UAV-view images.

Firstly, it is argued that detail loss may be induced by sparsity-based models, which eliminate bases with low coefficients. Therefore, a geometric approach is proposed to preserve details, with the incorporation of Gaussian curvature as a regularization term for both noise suppression and detail preservation. Secondly, the deep image prior is used to establish the optimization backbone. This framework harnesses the translation in-variance and smoothness properties of CNN as a tightly supervised recovery mechanism for effective noise suppression.

In this letter, we propose a Semantic-aware Adaptive Prompt Learning method based on Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (SAP-CLIP) for UniMDA classification tasks. Concretely, we utilize the CLIP with learnable prompts to leverage textual information of both class semantics and domain representations, thus helping the model detect unknown samples and tackle domain shifts. Besides, we propose a novel margin loss with a dynamic scoring function to enlarge the margin distance between known and unknown sample sets, facilitating a more precise classification.

Due to the fact that most existing methods neglect the valuable clues of edge information, it is difficult to precisely pinpoint the target segment as the target moment is complex. To this end, this paper proposes a novel perception network, Gazing After Glancing(GAG), to utilize edge information. Inspired by human reading habits, we propose a localization strategy of glancing and gazing, and using this strategy, we divide the proposed VMR task with the perceptual network into two stages, “glancing” and “gazing”. The glancing stage utilizes a commonly used coarse-grained feature encoder and an edge-guided span predictor to locate the approximate area. The gazing stage leverages the edge information extracted from the result of “glancing” to recalibrate the query feature. Specifically, we propose an edge-guided highlighting block to recalibrate the encoded query feature according to the visual edge semantic information. Then the refined query feature and visual feature are utilized by the edge-guided span predictor. Moreover, we employ the distillation to enhance the ability of the coarse-grained feature encoder.

Currently, Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) is working on the standardization of learning-based image compression as JPEG AI. It adopts a deep neural network based encoder-decoder architecture with hyperprior based probability formulation for entropy coding. JPEG AI currently contains two coding profiles: Base Operating Point (BaseOP) and High Operating Point (HighOP). Among the various techniques developed in JPEG AI, Multistage Context Model (MCM) was adopted as the context model to perform intra prediction in HighOP. It transforms the spatially progressive context prediction into sub-image feature prediction among channels via feature down-shuffling. However, in this prediction process, sub-image features are not spatially aligned to each other, and directly using the neighboring sub-image features cannot provide accurate prediction. Moreover, the distributions of residual features generated by MCM are also not consistent with that of the hyper scale decoder, which is used to construct the probability model in the entropy coding of residual features, leading to suboptimal residual coding. To address the above problems, we propose an Aligned Intra Prediction (AIP) and Aligned Hyper Scale Decoder (AHSD) under MCM for JPEG AI coding. AIP aligns the reference sub-image features to the to-be-predicted feature in MCM. AHSD further generates hyper scale features with matched distributions to the residual features.

TSIF consists of linear and cross-modal transformer modules with different duties. The linear transformer module efficiently performs the global interaction for multimodal signals, and the vital philosophy is to replace the dot product similarity with the Exponential Kernel while achieving linear complexity by a low-rank matrix decomposition. By targeting the language modality, the cross-modal transformer module aims to capture reliable element correlations among distinct signals and mitigate noise interference in audio and visual modalities.

The proposed method decouples potential feature into two components for learning consistency and diversity, respectively, and integrates these features for data reconstruction. The consistency and diversity feature are concatenated for spectral clustering. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2024.3408606,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10545549,Multi-view clustering;contrastive learning;data reconstruction,Representation learning;Matrix decomposition;Clustering methods;Optimization;Measurement;Data models;Task analysis,,4,,39,IEEE,3 Jun 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Inspired by recent emergence of large image-text datasets and breakthrough visual-language models, we propose to advance OMID with text's supervision for the first time. To this end, our key idea is to establish the relationship between one-shot multispectral instance with ImageNet class labels via the CLIP model. Particularly, we retrieve, rank, and ensemble the text features of ImageNet labels via instance image feature as query. Then the resulting instance image and text features are realigned and fused to obtain a multimodal feature. Meanwhile, a multispectral contrastive learning approach is proposed to drive multimodal feature learning for OMID. Note that all the procedures are end-to-end trained in a unified network.

In this letter, we tackle this hitherto unaddressed hypercomplex variant of the popular phase retrieval (PR) problem. We propose octonion Wirtinger flow (OWF) to recover an octonion signal from its intensity-only observation. However, contrary to the complex-valued Wirtinger flow, the non-associative nature of octonion algebra and the consequent lack of octonion derivatives make the extension to OWF non-trivial. We resolve this using the pseudo-real-matrix representation of octonion to perform the derivatives in each OWF update.

To address the above problems, this paper proposes a novel method for EEG-based emotion recognition named Spatiotemporal Gated Graph Transformer (SGGT). The method takes advantage of graph structure to enrich spatial information and uses a two-tower transformer to encode spatial information and temporal information, respectively. For the spatial feature extraction, we adopt four encoding methods to compensate for the shortcomings of traditional transformers in graph learning tasks. Different from the previous processing methods, our method uses graph pooling to compress the graph, forcing the model to learn the relationship between different time stamps. In addition, a gating mechanism is used to merge the two-tower transformer to realize the fusion of temporal and spatial features.

Alternatively, this paper proposes to improve compression by fully exploiting the existing DNN capacity. To do so, the latent features are guided to learn a richer and more diverse set of features, which corresponds to better reconstruction. A channel-wise feature decorrelation loss is designed and is integrated into the LC optimization. Three strategies are proposed and evaluated, which optimize (1) the transformation network, (2) the context model, and (3) both networks.

However, when the corrupted part is extensive, intrinsic information alone within visual modality is insufficient to inpaint the entire image. Cross-modal image inpainting methods cannot guarantee image quality, as they do not explore the relationship among the corrupted part of the image, the remaining part of the image, and the non-visual modality.

Recent advances in this issue can be roughly grouped into parametric clustering and representation learning. Although both of them have demonstrated exceptional performance, the efficacy of combining these two techniques remains unexplored. To this end, we propose a new framework named INS-NID (INteractive Supervision for New Intent Discovery). This framework is designed to build a bridge between parametric clustering and representation learning. In practice, INS-NID comprises a parametric clustering branch and a representation learning branch, which work collaboratively and provide interactive supervision to boost each other. Specifically, the representation learning branch provides reliable distribution estimation during training, which is used to regularize the cluster assignments of the parametric clustering.

To enhance layerwise convolution kernel reconstruction, this paper proposes a hybrid method via combining coresets theory and structural re-parameterization, enabling shallow transfer learning (STL) during inference time pruning. Firstly, our method achieves STL by implementing structural re-parameterization in the process of convolution kernel reconstruction, to adapt to effects of one layer's reconstruction loss on the next layers' inputs. Secondly, a channel-wise scaling process is designed on the basis of coresets theory, to enhance approximation in the mapping from drifted inputs to original feature maps. Selectively, a maximum mean discrepancy based decision-making process is built for switching in two patterns of our method. Tests are executed on image classification and arrhythmia detection.

As a covert communication form, text steganography discreetly embeds information by adding low-amplitude noise, significantly complicating its detection, and making steganographic texts increasingly difficult to identify. Existing steganalysis models achieve high detection accuracy by assuming that the training and testing sets are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d). However, meeting the i.i.d. requirement between training and testing datasets is impractical in real-world scenarios because it is often impossible to pinpoint which texts contain steganography or to identify the algorithms used in their creation. Therefore, obtaining labeled data for training is often unfeasible, and training models with each pair of source and target domains for each task significantly inconveniences the practical application of steganalysis models. Given these detection challenges, we propose a test-time adaptive steganalysis paradigm to accommodate detection scenarios without training data. Employing a generic pre-trained language model as a foundation and optimizing the model during testing allows it to self-adjust to new and varied data sets. The model relies only on the test data and its parameters in this fully test-time adaptation setting.

The main goal is to address potential identifiability issues in matrix completion with sparse observations by using a probabilistic sampling approach. Although conventional leverage sampling is commonly employed for designing sampling patterns, it often assigns high sampling probability to locations with low received signal strength (RSS) values, leading to a low sampling efficiency. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the leverage score produces pseudo images of sources, and in the regions around the source locations, the leverage probability is asymptotically consistent with the RSS. Based on this finding, an energy-modified leverage probability-based sampling strategy is investigated for efficient sampling.

Therefore, a large number of researchers are focusing on this topic research and have acquired many valuable research achievements. However, there still exist many problems that need to be solved for practical applications, such as the impact of identity and appearance differences, posture change etc. In this work, a dual-branch residual disentangled adversarial learning network is proposed to learn more accurate expression features by disentangling the non-expression features from basic features through a novel combinatorial loss function.

Among these, the NetVLAD is a popular framework that transforms the classical Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) method into a modern data-driven model. Introducing learnability in VLAD has led to several variants of NetVLAD, such as Patch-NetVLAD. However, many of these use only the bottleneck features of the backbone model, ignoring the rest of the feature hierarchy. A few state-of-the-art models adopt complex architectures to improve the quality of features. In this letter, we propose a simple extension to the NetVLAD that leverages the feature representations from intermediate layers of the CNN backbone in addition to the bottleneck features. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the significance of these intermediate features for VPR.

Synthetic aperture imaging (SAI) has emerged as a solution by integrating visual information from multiple viewpoints, thus overcoming occlusions. Event cameras, characterized by their high temporal resolution, exceptional dynamic range, low power consumption, and resistance to motion blur, offer a promising avenue for capturing intricate details of background objects within a limited range of motion. Leveraging these capabilities, several event-camera-based SAI methodologies have been proposed to effectively tackle dense occlusions. Despite these advancements, existing methodologies encounter obstacles stemming from the hybrid model they employ, comprising a spiking neural network (SNN) encoder and a convolutional neural network (CNN) decoder. Challenges include information degradation within the SNN encoder due to the quantization of full-precision data into binary spikes, as well as insufficient training data for the CNN decoder to adequately learn feature extraction. In response, we present an enhanced event-based image de-occlusion approach.

Generative error correction (GER) leverages the exceptional text comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLM), delivering impressive performance in ASR error correction, where N-best hypotheses provide valuable information for transcription prediction. However, GER encounters challenges such as fixed N-best hypotheses, insufficient utilization of acoustic information, and limited specificity to multi-accent scenarios. In this paper, we explore the application of GER in multi-accent scenarios. Accents represent deviations from standard pronunciation norms, and the multi-task learning framework for simultaneous ASR and accent recognition (AR) has effectively addressed the multi-accent scenarios, making it a prominent solution. In this work, we propose a unified ASR-AR GER model, named MMGER, leveraging multi-modal correction, and multi-granularity correction. Multi-task ASR-AR learning is employed to provide dynamic 1-best hypotheses and accent embeddings. Multi-modal correction accomplishes fine-grained frame-level correction by force-aligning the acoustic features of speech with the corresponding character-level 1-best hypothesis sequence. Multi-granularity correction supplements the global linguistic information by incorporating regular 1-best hypotheses atop fine-grained multi-modal correction to achieve coarse-grained utterance-level correction. MMGER effectively mitigates the limitations of GER and tailors LLM-based ASR error correction for the multi-accent scenarios.

Moreover, in order to speed-up convergence, an accelerated version of the CTPD (A-CTPD) algorithm is also presented.

The recently developed image rescaling techniques provide a storage and transmission economic way to deal with this problem, by jointly learning the downscaling and upscaling mappings for the images with the aid of the invertible neural network (INN). In the original pipeline, the high-frequency information is generally discarded in the downscaled low-resolution (LR) image, while is randomly sampled when doing upscaling, so that the storage and transmission cost can be minimal. However, the quality of the reconstructed HR image is limited due to the ignorance of the high-frequency information, and thus there are researchers trying to improve the upscaling performance by paying a bit more storage to partially save the high-frequency features. In this work, following this research line, we propose a new strategy to improve the image rescaling performance by more efficiently utilizing additional storage. Specifically, instead of saving the partial high-frequency features, we propose to quantize those features with a learned codebook and save the corresponding index matrix. Such a vector quantization strategy can recover as much as possible high-frequency features, and thus leads to a better image rescaling performance.

In this letter, we introduce a real-time and scale-aware 3D Pedestrian Detection, which incorporates a robust encoder network designed for effective pillar feature extraction. The Proposed TriFocus Attention module (TriFA), which integrates external attention and similar attention strategies based on Squeeze and Exception. By comprehensively supervising the point-wise, channel-wise, and pillar-wise of pillar features, it enhances the encoding ability of pillars, suppresses noise in pillar features, and enhances the expression ability of pillar features. The proposed Bidirectional Scale-Aware Feature Pyramid module (BiSAFP) integrates a scale-aware module into the multi-scale pyramid structure. This addition enhances its ability to perceive pedestrian within low-level features. Moreover, it ensures that the significance of feature maps across various feature levels is fully taken into account. BiSAFP represents a lightweight multi-scale pyramid network that minimally impacts inference time while substantially boosting network performance. Our approach achieves real-time detection, processing up to 30 frames per second (FPS).",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2024.3426294,"Youth Innovation Team Project of Higher Education Institutions in Shandong Province(grant numbers:2022KJ268); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFE0196000); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10595495,3D object detection;real-time;scale-aware;pillar-based,Feature extraction;Pedestrians;Three-dimensional displays;Point cloud compression;Encoding;Real-time systems;Object detection,,,,26,IEEE,11 Jul 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

However, omnipresent appearance variations such as occlusion, deformation, and scale changes can easily cause aberrations, leading to a decline in tracking accuracy. Moreover, consistent responses may exacerbate model overfitting issues. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time UAV tracking method leveraging the multiple response incongruity aberrance repression (MRIAR) correlation filter based on the DCF paradigm. This method comprises a feature response incongruity aberrance repression (FRIAR) regularization module and a target spatiotemporal response incongruity aberrance repression (TSRIAR) regularization module. Tracking accuracy and reliability can be enhanced by implementing aberrance repression for incongruous response map variance rates. Furthermore, a dynamic spatiotemporal variance response map is introduced into the TSRIAR module to capture the variation information of the target response between spatiotemporal frames, thereby further strengthening aberrance repression.

This suggests that only a limited range of contextual spatial information is obtained. To remedy this problem above, a U-Net-like RDH predictor named UCANet is proposed in this paper to capture rich multi-scale contextual information by gradually downsampling feature maps. To fuse two feature maps at different levels along the channel dimension, we put forward the channel adaptive attention (CAA). By merely combining cheap pointwise convolution operations, CAA achieves the integration of non-linear and linear features as well as implicitly enhances channel dimensionality with low computational burden, thereby effectively enriching the expression of the channel information. The design of UCANet considers the characteristics of RDH from two aspects. On the one hand, instead of maxpooling or average pooling commonly used for downsampling, a stride-2 convolution block that can adaptively adjust the weights of convolution kernels and select useful information is utilized to downsample feature maps. On the other hand, UCANet removes the batch normalization layers to avoid their influence on the distribution of feature maps, which helps to strengthen the network's prediction capability.

Current detection methods are either costly or heavily reliant on domain-specific knowledge. Data-driven methods show promising performance but encounter challenges such as extracting multi-scale features for blade icing detection from noisy sensor data and addressing the imbalance between icing and non-icing states. To overcome these challenges, we propose an innovative data-driven approach named Multilevel Signal Decomposition Layer-Specific Residual Network (MSD-LRN) for blade icing detection. Our model first employs wavelet decomposition to extract multi-scale features from noisy sensor data and then uses heterogeneous structures to learn the hidden knowledge at each scale. This heterogeneous structure is designed to address the issue of inconsistent information across different scales in wavelet transforms, where information successively decreases.

However, the vast differences in crowd density distributions across various areas within a scene make it difficult for existing crowd counting methods to achieve satisfactory performance. To address this issue, this letter introduces a novel method called Dynamic Density-Region-Aware Network (DDRANet). First, a Density-Aware Module (DAM) is designed to detect density variations and dynamically segment the image into multiple density regions. Subsequently, the Region Information Encoder (RIE) transforms the obtained density region map into a latent space to enhance the information of density regions. Then, through a specially designed Region Attention Block (RAB), the encoded density region map guides the model to focus on different density regions separately, enabling the model to adapt to the density variations of the crowd within the image. Furthermore, we combine Gaussian kernel function and Density Peak Clustering to automatically generate ground truth of density region maps, supervising the optimization of DAM. Extensive experimental results on three datasets demonstrate DDRANet's superior performance over other state-of-the-art methods.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2024.3446693,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10640213,Crowd counting;density-region awareness;density peak clustering;region attention,Dams;Head;Kernel;Convolution;Adaptation models;Annotations;Transforms,,2,,41,IEEE,20 Aug 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

In response, a low-complexity Hammerstein-type block-oriented functional link adaptive filter (HBO-FLAF) was recently developed, which requires less computation than that of the traditional FLAF.

However, most of the methods require complete or partial correspondence of multi-view instances which is hard to satisfy in many practical applications. To this end, this letter proposes a novel method termed Distribution-Level Multi-view Clustering for Unaligned Data (DLCU), which proves to be well-suited for scenarios where instance correspondences between different modalities are entirely absent. Specifically, in order to reconstruct cross-view correspondence, the wasserstein distance is employed to effectuate the alignment of multi-view data in distribution-level and guide the learning of cross-view transformation. Furthermore, the negative impact of the inevitable misalignment is mitigated through the global attention mechanism, which is designed to assign appropriate weights to realigned instances across multiple views.

In particular, we first create a latent low-rank space using self-supervised learning for each degraded images, from which we derive corresponding latent low-rank regularization. This regularization, combining with observed prior information and smoothness regularization, guides the reserve sampling process, resulting in the generation of high-quality images with fine-grained textures and fewer artifacts.

Thus low-complexity user activity detection with reliable approximate distributed inference in the form of message-passing is relevant.

The objective functions of most OR methods are based on the misclassification error. The volume under the ROC surface (VUS) is a measure of OR that quantifies the ranking ability of OR models. It can also be used as an objective function in OR. In practice, data may be collected by multiple nodes in a distributed and online manner, and is difficult to process centrally. In this paper, we intend to develop a VUS-based distributed online OR method. Computing VUS requires a sequence of data from all categories, but the available online data may not cover all categories and the required data may distribute across different nodes.

To alleviate this conflict, we design a parametric binaural (PaBi) BF from the viewpoint of auditory perception. In human hearing, the binaural cues are frequency selective, i.e., the interaural phase difference (IPD) dominates at low frequencies while the interaural level difference (ILD) dominates at high frequencies. Accordingly, we construct a set of parametric IPD and ILD constraints to establish a novel cost function, which is then solved by the semi-definite relaxation strategy.

To address this, we propose a brain lateralization-guided subject adaptive network, BLSAN, to enhance model generalization through local-global adversarial training. Specifically, two separate adversarial networks for left and right hemispheres are designed to reduce local differences, and features extracted from both hemispheres are combined for global adversarial training.

The GSIE module is designed to overcome the limitation of local information in traditional methods and facilitate global semantic information interaction by introducing multi-angle feature rotation to extend the receptive field. The AFF module effectively captures fine-grained features of objects by dynamically adjusting fusion weights, thereby reducing the loss of deep semantic information during feature transfer and fusion.

In speech-based dementia detection, the difficulty has remained the representation of an individual's sequential temporal variation of speech is related to dementia symptoms with fix-length features. In this letter, a novel feature extraction method is proposed for extracting fix-length features from unfixed-length audio recordings for dementia detection. When diagnosing dementia, an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system is necessary for extracting linguistic information when constructing an automatic dementia detection system. This letter uses wav2vec2.0, a self-supervised end-to-end ASR system, to achieve such a goal. Similar to the pipeline ASR system, which has been used for extracting the sequential speak-and-pause patterns related to dementia using estimated time alignment information, we propose using character-level transcripts to extract speak-and-pause patterns. Path signature technology, which can represent a sequential feature with a trajectory in the un-parameterised path space, is proposed to describe speak-and-pause patterns embedded in character-level transcripts into character path signatures. Similarly, the variable-length embedding matrices extracted from wav2vec2.0’s contextual layers are also represented with their acoustic path signatures.

These algebraic representations govern the fundamental concepts and tools in graph signal processing even though they reveal information in different ways. Furthermore, in the context of spectral graph classification, the problem of cospectrality may arise and it is not well handled by these matrices. Thus, the question of finding the best graph representation matrix still stands. In this letter, a new family of representations that well captures information about graphs and also allows to find the standard representation matrices, is introduced. This family of unified matrices well captures the graph information and extends the recent works of the literature. Two properties are proven, namely its positive semidefiniteness and the monotonicity of their eigenvalues.

Instead, it takes an inter-frame supervision using depth based view synthesis to reconstruct temporal adjacent frames to indirectly supervise the generated depth. However, such supervision weakens the depth estimation at temporal incoherent regions containing small changes among consecutive frames. To overcome the above problem, we propose a color and geometric contrastive learning based intra-frame supervision framework to enhance self-supervised monocular depth estimation. Color-contrastive learning is proposed to guide the network to learn color invariant features considering color information is irrelevant to depth data. To improve the local details of the learned feature, a pixel-level contrastive learning is further used to optimize the learning. In view that the depth estimation, as a pixel-level task, is sensitive to the geometric transformation, geometric-contrastive learning is developed using an inverse geometric transformation to learn features that are equivariant to the geometric data augmentation. A local plane guidance layer (LPG) with contrastive learning is further used to decompose the geometric information and enhance the geometric contrastive learning.

It uses a streamable language model (LM) with a context-aware approach to convert semantic features from automatic speech recognition (ASR) into acoustic features with the desired speaker timbre. Despite its innovations, StreamVoice faces challenges due to its dependency on a streaming ASR within a cascaded framework, which complicates system deployment and optimization, affects VC system's design and performance based on the choice of ASR, and struggles with conversion stability when faced with low-quality semantic inputs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce StreamVoice+, an enhanced LM-based end-to-end streaming framework that operates independently of streaming ASR. StreamVoice+ integrates a semantic encoder and a connector with the original StreamVoice framework, now trained using a non-streaming ASR. This model undergoes a two-stage training process: initially, the StreamVoice backbone is pre-trained for voice conversion and the semantic encoder for robust semantic extraction. Subsequently, the system is fine-tuned end-to-end, incorporating a LoRA matrix to activate comprehensive streaming functionality. Furthermore, StreamVoice+ mainly introduces two strategic enhancements to boost conversion quality: a residual compensation mechanism in the connector to ensure effective semantic transmission and a self-refinement strategy that leverages pseudo-parallel speech pairs generated by the conversion backbone to improve speech decoupling.

In this letter, we propose a Masked Guided Meta-Learning (MGML) framework for domain-adaptive nighttime semantic segmentation. Within the MGML framework, we explore two key issues: how to generate the latent domain, and how to leverage the latent domain to assist meta-learning in reducing domain discrepancy. For the first issue, we employ the fast Fourier transform along with a complementary masking strategy to generate masked latent images that resemble the target scenes in the latent domain without adding to the training burden. For the second issue, we nest a mask-based consistency constraint within a bi-level meta-learning framework, enabling cross-domain knowledge acquired from the pair of “source-to-latent” to enhance the “latent-to-target” adaptation. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our MGML achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in nighttime semantic segmentation.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2024.3465352,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62406051); Aeronautical Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:2022Z037059001,20220001059001); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10684563,Nighttime semantic segmentation;mask-based consistency constraint;meta-learning,Metalearning;Adaptation models;Semantic segmentation;Training;Optimization;Fast Fourier transforms;Semantics,,,,37,IEEE,19 Sep 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Firstly, RGB and depth embeddings from the initial layers of the network are fused together. Secondly, the fused features are enhanced by pure RGB embeddings and are progressively guided by semantic edge labels to suppress irrelevant features.

Deep learning has significantly enhanced the performance of super-resolution techniques for remote sensing imagery. However, increasing the depth of networks and the size of their parameters has resulted in substantial computational and storage burdens. To address this challenge, we propose an adaptive approach that learns both local and global information for each region. We introduce a lightweight hybrid model named the Efficient Adaptive Feature Fusion Network, which combines CNNs and Transformers to fully exploit the texture information in remote sensing images. This model leverages local details and long-range dependencies within images in an adaptive manner to achieve superior super-resolution. Specifically, a set of Transformers is employed to model the self-similarity between pixels and perform dense texture pattern predictions at each pixel, while a set of CNNs captures local details within the images. The computed global and local features serve as inputs to the proposed Adaptive Contextual Fusion Block, which learns to fuse local and global information across different regions to generate robust image super-resolution features.

HF2TNet: A Hierarchical Fusion Two-Stage Training Network for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion,T. Lv; C. Ji; H. Jiang; Y.

These limit effective information aggregation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hierarchical fusion strategy with a two-stage training network, abbreviated as HF2TNet, which achieves effective information aggregation in a staged manner. In the initial training stage, a three-stream encoder-decoder architecture is proposed, seamlessly integrating CNN and transformer modules. This architecture extracts both global and local features from visible and infrared images, capturing their shared attributes before the fusion process. Moreover, a multi-shared attention module (MSAM) is proposed to profoundly reconstruct and augment the visible and infrared features, ensuring the preservation and enhancement of details across modalities. In the subsequent stage, HF2TNet utilizes the pre-integrated features as query inputs for the dual MSAMs. These modules interact with the previously reconstructed infrared and visible features to enhance complementary information and ensure a balanced feature fusion. Experimental results indicate HF2TNet's superior performance on standard datasets like MSRS and TNO, especially in complex scenes, demonstrating its potential in multimodal image fusion.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2024.3486113,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62176081); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10734176,CNN;deep learning;image fusion;transformer,Feature extraction;Training;Image reconstruction;Image fusion;Transformers;Decoding;Convolution;Vectors;Signal processing algorithms;Sensor phenomena and characterization,,1,,32,IEEE,24 Oct 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals
Robust Multi-Prototypes Aware Integration for Zero-Shot Cross-Domain Slot Filling,S. Chen; P. Huang; Z. Zhu; Y. Zhang; Y.

Dominant two-step hierarchical models first extract slot entities and then calculate the similarity score between slot description-based prototypes and the last hidden layer of the slot entity, selecting the closest prototype as the predicted slot type. However, these models only use slot descriptions as prototypes, which lacks robustness. Moreover, these approaches have less regard for the inherent knowledge in the slot entity embedding to suffer from the issue of overfitting. In this letter, we propose a Robust Multi-prototypes Aware Integration (RMAI) method for zero-shot cross-domain slot filling. In RMAI, more robust slot entity-based prototypes and inherent knowledge in the slot entity embedding are utilized to improve the classification performance and alleviate the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, a multi-prototypes aware integration approach is proposed to effectively integrate both our proposed slot entity-based prototypes and the slot description-based prototypes. Experimental results on the SNIPS dataset demonstrate the well performance of RMAI.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2024.3495561,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71472068); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10749999,Cross-domain learning;slot filling;spoken language understanding;zero-shot learning,Prototypes;Filling;Logic gates;Training;Predictive models;Overfitting;Humanities;Biological system modeling;Zero shot learning;Semantics,,,,23,IEEE,11 Nov 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

While the former methods offer fast inference, the latter generate diverse images. This work aims to solve these issues and achieve the best of both regimes in a principled manner via Bayesian reformulation of the GAN objective. We highlight a hidden expectation term over GAN parameters, that is often overlooked but is critical in few-shot settings. This observation helps us justify prepending a latent adapter network (LAN) before a pre-trained GAN and propose a sampling procedure over the parameters of LAN (called SoLAD) to compute the usually-ignored hidden expectation. SoLAD enables fast generation of quality samples from multiple few-shot target domains using a GAN pre-trained on a single source domain.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2024.3496822,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10750383,Few shot image generation;GANs,Generative adversarial networks;Generators;Training;Optimization;Vectors;Pediatrics;Bayes methods;Overfitting;Gaussian noise;Feature extraction,,1,,38,IEEE,11 Nov 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals
Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease Based on Hybrid Fusion Approach of Offline Handwriting Images,S. Dong; J. Liu; J.

However, existing methods have not explored the potential of the fusion of different handwriting image sources for diagnosis. To address this issue, this study proposes a hybrid fusion approach that makes use of the visual information derived from different handwriting images and handwriting templates, significantly enhancing the performance in diagnosing Parkinson's disease. The proposed method involves several key steps. Initially, different preprocessed handwriting images undergo pixel-level fusion using Laplacian transformation. Subsequently, the fused and original images are fed into a pre-trained CNN separately to extract visual features. Finally, feature-level fusion is performed by concatenating the feature vectors extracted from the flatten layer, and the fused feature vectors are input into SVM to obtain classification results. Our experimental results validate that the proposed method achieves excellent performance by only utilizing visual features from images, with 95.45% accuracy on the NewHandPD. Furthermore, the results obtained on our dataset verify the strong generalizability of the proposed approach.",1558-2361,,10.1109/LSP.2024.3496579,"National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFF1201200); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62172444); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2022JJ30753); Central South University Innovation-Driven Research Programme(grant numbers:2023CXQD018); High Performance Computing Center of Central South University; ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10750464,Handwriting images;hybrid fusion approach;Laplacian transformation;Parkinson's disease;pre-trained CNN,Feature extraction;Diseases;Visualization;Vectors;Image color analysis;Convolutional neural networks;Accuracy;Image edge detection;Writing;Transforms,,2,,22,IEEE,12 Nov 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals
