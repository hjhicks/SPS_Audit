Most BIQA methods directly use the pre-trained model to extract features and then perform feature fusion. However, the features extracted by pre-trained models may contain irrelevant information to BIQA. Although some methodspre-train the feature extraction network from scratch, these approaches raise computational costs and resource demands. In this letter, a Feature-selected Pyramid Network(FsPN) is proposed to address this issue from a different perspective. First, a spatial selection module selects useful information from the features extracted by the pre-trained model. Additionally, a pyramid network based on skip connections is utilized to fuse the selected multi-scale features. The proposed method is verified in six public datasets, where it consistently outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods, affirming its effectiveness and adaptability.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2024.3475912","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52275003); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2023YFB4704000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10706861","Blind image quality assessment;feature pyramid network;spatial selection module","Feature extraction;Image quality;Convolution;Distortion;Residual neural networks;Computational modeling;Interpolation;Filters;Transformers;Training","","2","","31","IEEE","7 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing methods of exploring the vision-language relationships between questions, images, and scene text have achieved impressive results. However, these studies heavily rely on auxiliary modules, such as external OCR systems and object detection networks, making the question-answering process cumbersome and highly dependent. In addition, OCR text is treated as textual content only in these approaches, while its visual learning is ignored. To alleviate the above problems, we propose a novel end-to-end dual-stream multi-loss training approach called DSTA. Our model first integrates a text spotter into multimodal learning to incorporate overall textual and visual OCR features. Specifically, we propose a novel dual-stream multi-loss training strategy that improves multimodal understanding while training question-answering. In addition, we design OCR Contrastive Learning (OCL) to enhance vision-language understanding by exploring the multimodal features of OCR text in depth. Experiments show that DSTA outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on two STVQA benchmarks without any extra training data.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2024.3486104","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:XDA27030600); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10734181","Visual question-answering;multimodal information;sence-text understanding","Optical character recognition;Training;Visualization;Feature extraction;Transformers;Text recognition;Contrastive learning;Belts;Predictive models;Decoding","","","","35","IEEE","24 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the model may be affected by corner cases, which are rare or unusual objects and scenarios, and can significantly impact the reliability of object detection systems. In this paper, we applied a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to address the challenge of corner cases in autonomous driving systems. The MLLM consists of an image encoder, a text tokenizer, a modal alignment layer, and a pre-trained large language model, enabling the model to understand multimodal semantic information. We added text descriptions on the basis of corner case dataset CODA and constructed the CODA-REC dataset. This dataset is then used to perform instruction fine-tuning on the MLLM to adapt it to the object detection task. The proposed method leverages the extensive knowledge and zero-shot learning capabilities of LLMs to enhance the semantic understanding of text and images, enabling the detection and appropriate response to corner cases that were previously difficult to handle. The experimental results show that MLLM achieved better performance than baseline models, with an improvement of about 10% in mAR and mAP metrics compared to most closed-set models, and an improvement of 10% mAP compared to open set models.

Existing NFSL methods directly employ delicately designed pseudo-noise to simulate and adapt to noisy environments. However, determining the optimal combination of pseudo-noise is challenging and improperly configuring pseudo-noise may lead to adverse effects on the training models. To deal with the problems, this letter proposes a novel Adaptive MultI-view Denoising Evaluation (AMIDE) framework, which establishes an adaptive and robust embedding and classifier without relying on pseudo-noise. In the training phase, we design an adaptive label smoothing scheme, where soft labels with learnable smooth coefficients are inferred from data distribution to mitigate overconfident labeling. In the testing stage, we propose a multi-view fused evaluation scheme, where different network layers are treated as distinct views to generate potential clean features and modify prototypes, thereby enhancing the accuracy of evaluation. In this way, the impact of noise is effectively alleviated from two perspectives.

Properly distinguishing the processing of RGB and depth images is essential to fully exploiting their unique and significant characteristics. To address this, we propose a novel heterogeneous dual-branch framework called HDBFormer, specifically designed to handle these modality differences. For RGB images, which contain rich detail, we employ both a basic and detail encoder to extract local and global features. For the simpler depth images, we propose LDFormer, a lightweight hierarchical encoder that efficiently extracts depth features with fewer parameters. Additionally, we introduce the Modality Information Interaction Module (MIIM), which combines transformers with large kernel convolutions to interact global and local information across modalities efficiently.

In practice, it is difficult to estimate locally which order fits the best, and to choose too high an order, typically larger than two, when not necessary results in both an inaccurate estimation and an increased sensitivity to noise. To circumvent this, we propose to localize linear chirp points in modes to find out where second order phase approximation is sufficient for the estimation, and then build a new IF estimate based on a weighted spline approximation based on these points.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a many-to-many singing performance style transfer system that converts the pitch and energy contours of one singer's style to another singer's. To achieve this target, we utilize two AutoVC-like autoencoders with an information bottleneck to automatically disentangle performance style from other musical contents, one for the pitch contour while another for the energy contour.

However, existing GAN inversion methods can only invert images with fixed resolutions; this significantly restricts the representation capability in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose to invert images by patches, thus named as patch inverter, which is the first attempt in terms of block-wise inversion for arbitrary resolutions. More specifically, we develop the padding-free operation to ensure the continuity across patches, and analyse the intrinsic mismatch within the inversion procedure. To relieve the mismatch, we propose a shifted convolution operation, which retains the continuity across image patches and simultaneously enlarges the receptive field for each convolution layer. We further propose the reciprocal loss to regularize the inverted latent codes to reside on the original latent generating space, such that the rich semantics can be maximally preserved. Experimental results have demonstrated that our patch inverter is able to accurately invert images with arbitrary resolutions, whilst representing precise and rich image semantics in real-world scenarios.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2024.3506859","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62206011,62250001,62231002); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L223021); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10767750","Block-wise synthesis;GAN inversion;representation learning","Inverters;Image resolution;Image reconstruction;Convolution;Semantics;Generators;Accuracy;Codes;Image restoration;Generative adversarial networks","","2","","42","IEEE","27 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A typical approach to SED is to train a deep neural network (DNN) in a supervised manner such that the model predicts frame-wise event activities. Since the predicted activities often contain fine insertion and deletion errors due to their temporal fluctuations, post-processing has been applied to obtain more accurate onset and offset boundaries. Existing post-processing methods are, however, non-differentiable and prohibit end-to-end (E2E) training. In this paper, we propose an E2E detection method based on a probabilistic formulation of sound event sequences called a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM). The HSMM is utilized to transform frame-wise features predicted by a DNN into posterior probabilities of sound events represented by their class labels and temporal boundaries. We jointly train the DNN and HSMM in a supervised E2E manner by maximizing the event-wise posterior probabilities of the HSMM. This objective is a differentiable function thanks to the forward-backward algorithm of the HSMM.

However, a notable limitation of most existing FSL methods is that they focus only on local information and less on the critical role of global information. Based on this, this paper proposes a new feature processing method with adaptive band selection, which takes into account the global nature of image features. Firstly, adaptive band analysis is performed in the target domain, and threshold analysis is used to determine the number of selected bands. Secondly, a band selection method is employed to select representative bands from the spectral bands of the high-dimensional data according to the determined band count. Finally, the weights of the selected bands are analyzed, fully considering the importance of pixel weight, and then the results are used as inputs for the classification model.

Besides, mainstream approaches (e.g., CLAP) usually treat the annotated pairs as positives and consider all other audio-caption combinations as negatives, assuming a binary relevance between audio samples and captions. To infer the relevance between audio samples and arbitrary captions, we propose a method that computes non-binary audio-caption relevance scores based on the textual similarities of audio captions. We measure textual similarities of audio captions by calculating the cosine similarity of their Sentence-BERT embeddings and then transform these similarities into audio-caption relevance scores using a logistic function, thereby linking audio samples through their annotated captions to all other captions in the dataset. To integrate the computed relevances into training, we employ a listwise ranking objective, where relevance scores are converted into probabilities of ranking audio samples for a given textual query.

The primary requirement for such detection is generalizability, typically achieved by training on numerous fake images from various models. However, practical limitations, such as closed-source models and restricted access, often result in limited training samples. Therefore, training a general detector with few-shot samples is essential for modern detection mechanisms. To address this challenge, we propose FAMSeC, a general AI-generated image detection method based on LoRA-based Forgery Awareness Module and Semantic feature-guided Contrastive learning strategy.

However, their low spatial resolution often limits their use in applications such as image segmentation and recognition. In previous works, generating high-resolution hyperspectral (HR-HS) images required the use of low-resolution hyperspectral (LR-HS) images and high-resolution RGB (HR-RGB) images as priors, which increases the cost of data collection and may lead to measurement and calibration errors in practical applications. Although the currently popular CNN-based single hyperspectral image super-resolution (single HS-SR) methods have improved performance, they are not flexible enough to process images with different degradation. From a visual perspective, the generated super-resolution images exhibit a significant smudging effect due to the loss of information. Leveraging multi-modal techniques and generative prior, we propose DiffHSR that marks a significant leap in LR-HS images super-restoration without HR-RGB. Additionally, we have established a connection between hyperspectral images and the RGB image-based generative model tasks using low-cost data and fine-tuning approaches, which creates a novel paradigm.

This letter investigates the impact of compression strategies in centralized Bayesian FL setups, where a Parameter Sever (PS) is tasked to supervise the learning process. The goal is to study how compression affects the ability of Bayesian FL systems to provide high-quality, yet well-calibrated ML models. The analysis is carried out in the healthcare domain, where the prediction reliability is particularly critical, focusing on a medical imaging task.

When GPs are used for regression, the goal is to estimate a target signal ${y}$ from an input vector $\mathbf {x}$ without assuming that they are linearly related, but with a probabilistic model $p({y}|\mathbf {x})$ that is Gaussian distributed. Therefore, GPs can be understood as a natural nonlinear extension to MMSE estimation. For real-valued GPs, this has been analyzed in the existing literature, and it is concluded that they are the natural nonlinear Bayesian extension to the linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) estimation. In this letter, we show that, consequently, complex-valued GP regression (GPR) models are the natural nonlinear Bayesian extension of the widely linear minimum mean squared-error (WLMMSE) estimation. As in the real-valued case, complex-valued GPs are able to better model many regression problems by making use of the information that the complementary kernel or pseudo-kernel provides.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2024.3515818","MICIU/AEI/(grant numbers:10.13039/501100011033); ERDF/EU(grant numbers:PID2021-127871OB-I00,PID2021-123182OB-I00); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10791914","Bayesian regression;complex-valued Gaussian processes (GP);widely linear MMSE estimation","Kernel;Covariance matrices;Bayes methods;Vectors;Estimation;Gaussian processes;Training;Standards;Predictive models;Wiener filters","","","","13","CCBY","11 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, diffusion models have gained lots of attention in speech enhancement area, achieving competitive results. Current diffusion-based methods blur the distribution of the signal with isotropic Gaussian noise and recover clean speech distribution from the prior. However, these methods often suffer from a substantial computational burden. We argue that the computational inefficiency partially stems from the oversight that speech enhancement is not purely a generative task; it primarily involves noise reduction and completion of missing information, while the clean clues in the original mixture do not need to be regenerated. In this paper, we propose a method that introduces noise with anisotropic guidance during the diffusion process, allowing the neural network to preserve clean clues within noisy recordings. This approach substantially reduces computational complexity while exhibiting robustness against various forms of noise and speech distortion. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results with only approximately 4.5 million parameters, a number significantly lower than that required by other diffusion methods. This effectively narrows the model size disparity between diffusion-based and predictive speech enhancement approaches. Additionally, the proposed method performs well in very noisy scenarios, demonstrating its potential for applications in highly challenging environments.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2024.3522852","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFF0608501); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:12425413,12104483); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L247022); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10816305","Speech enhancement;generative diffusion models;anisotropic diffusion process","Anisotropic;Speech enhancement;Noise;Noise measurement;Diffusion processes;Estimation;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Training;Stochastic processes;Spectrogram","","","","41","IEEE","26 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, to achieve rotation invariance in iris recognition, we employ relative position encoding instead of regular absolute position encoding for each iris image token, and a horizontal pixel-shifting strategy is utilized during training for data augmentation. Then, to enhance the model's robustness against local distortions such as occlusions and reflections, we randomly mask some tokens during training to force the model to learn representative identity features from only part of the image. Finally, considering that fine-grained features are more discriminative in iris recognition, we retain the entire token sequence for patch-wise feature matching instead of using the standard single classification token.

However, this compression approach overlooks the utilization of background information, which limits its adaptability to different scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Surveillance Video Compression framework based on background hyperprior, dubbed as ASVC. This background hyperprior is related with side information to assist in coding both the temporal and spatial domains. Our method mainly consists of two components. First, the background information from a GOP is extracted, modeled as hyperprior and is compressed by exiting methods. Then these hyperprior is used as side information to compress both I frames and P frames.

On this basis, we rethought the principle of LS and LLMs, and proposed the classification mode. In this mode, LS-G/C deleted the LS-task âdescriptionâ and used the âcausalLMâ LLMs to extract steganographic features. The LS features can be extracted by only one pass of the model, and a linear layer with initialization weights is added to obtain the classification probability. Experiments on strongly concealed stegos show that LS-G/C significantly improves detection and reaches SOTA performance. Additionally, LS-G/C in classification mode greatly reduces training time while maintaining high performance.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2024.3496817","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U21B2020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10752347","Classification mode;efficient steganalysis;generation mode;linguistic steganalysis;LLMs","Training;Knowledge engineering;Steganography;Neural networks;Linguistics;Feature extraction","","3","","34","IEEE","13 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this issue, we propose a frequency decoupled MAE. Specifically, by incorporating a scale-specific frequency feature reconstruction module, we delve into leveraging frequency information as a direct and explicit target for reconstruction, which augments the MAE's capability to discern and accurately reproduce diverse frequency attributes within the data. Moreover, in order to address the issue of unstable gradient updates caused by more complex optimization objectives with frequency reconstruction, we introduce a dual-path network combined with an exponential moving average (EMA) parameter updating strategy to guide the model in stabilizing the training process.

Recently, nuclear norm minimization-based methods have made certain progress in robust tensor completion. However, the tensor nuclear norm applies the same constraint to all singular values, resulting in insufficient capturing power for the global structure of the HSI. In addition, as a convex surrogate of global low-rankness, tensor nuclear norm minimization leads to an overall low-rank approximation that cannot capture the details of the HSI. In this letter, we propose the spatial-spectral constrained deep low-rank tensor factorization (SDLTF). More precisely, the low-rank tensor factorization is used to dynamically assign penalty weights, aiming to preserve the main information and maintain the global structure of the HSI. The spatial-spectral constrained unsupervised deep prior is applied within a deep convolutional neural network to capture spatial-spectral correlations and local details of the HSI.

However, existing state-of-the-art AVQA methods often rely on simplistic machine learning models or fully connected networks for audio-visual signal fusion, which limits their ability to exploit the complementary nature of these modalities. In response to this gap, we propose a novel no-reference AVQA method that utilizes joint cross-attention fusion of audio-visual perception. Our approach begins with a dual-stream feature extraction process that simultaneously captures long-range spatiotemporal visual features and audio features. The fusion model then dynamically adjusts the contributions of features from both modalities, effectively integrating them to provide a more comprehensive perception for quality score prediction.

Based on this, we propose a new FER method based heterogeneous dual-branch emotional consistency constrains, to prevent the model from memorizing noise samples based on features associated with noisy labels. In the proposed method, the emotion consistency from spatial transformation and heterogeneous networks are simultaneously considered to guide the model to perceive the overall visual features of expressions.

This study presents a straightforward and effective method called Det RCNN to detect pedestrians in crowded situation, while also pairing the body and head of individual pedestrian. On the one hand, pedestrians' heads have their characteristics of stable shape and distinct feature. On the other hand, their heads are usually positioned higher in image, so even in crowded situation, it is difficult to completely cover the pedestrians' heads. Therefore, this study equipped the DETR model with a Head Decoder (HDecoder) parallel to the Decoder. HDecoder takes the head knowledge generated in the Decoder phase as head queries. Simultaneously, the HDecoder uses a key-query mechanism to search the entire image for the body bounding boxes corresponding to the head queries. Lastly, the proposed method conducts a straightforward IOU (Intersection over Union) matching between the body bounding boxes produced in the Decoder and HDecoder phases. This HDecoder resembles the second stage of the Faster RCNN model, hence this paper termed it Det RCNN (DETR RCNN). Compared to Deformable DETR, the experimental results on the CrowdHuman dataset show that the proposed model can increase AP$_{m}$ from 53.02 to 53.87.

However, in some intricate scenarios (e.g., similar objects or backgrounds, background clutter), DCF-based trackers are prone to generating low-reliability response maps influenced by surrounding response distractors, thereby reducing tracking robustness. Furthermore, the limited computational resources and endurance on UAV platforms drive DCF-based trackers to exhibit real-time and reliable tracking performance. To address the aforementioned issues, a dynamic distractor-repressed correlation filter (DDRCF) is proposed. First, a dynamic distractor-repressed regularization is introduced into the DCF framework. Then, a new objective function is formulated to tune the penalty intensity of the distractor-repressed regularization module.

However, the noisy and temporal nature of such data as well as their non-stationarity pose substantial challenges to current methodologies. DL models suffer from overfitting noise, frequently arising from the absence of strong priors. In this paper, we address the instability of trading DRL agents due to noise by proposing an end-to-end hybrid trainable filtering and feature extraction approach. The proposed method employs Gaussian filters as priors and can be attached at the beginning of any DL architecture forming a hybrid model-based and data-driven model that can directly process the raw input data. The bandwidth of the filters is determined through the learning process, ultimately allowing the agent to autonomously determine the optimal bandwidth for the task and data at hand, without requiring any additional supervision. Moreover, the proposed method leverages high-order derivatives to address the non-stationarity of financial data and provides multiple views of the input signal efficiently utilized by the subsequent model.

Recently, diffusion model has achieved great success in computer vision, which excels in generating images with more high-frequency details, yet suffers from time-consuming and extensive computational resource consumption. To alleviate these problems, we propose Frequency-Decomposed Diffusion Model (FDDM) that refines the high-frequency subbands of the dose map. To be specific, we design a Coarse Dose Prediction Module (CDPM) to first predict a coarse dose map and then utilize 2D discrete wavelet transform to decompose the coarse dose map into a low-frequency subband and three high-frequency subbands. There is a notable difference between the coarse predicted results and ground truth in high-frequency subbands. Therefore, we design a diffusion-based module called High-Frequency Refinement Module (HFRM) that performs diffusion operation in the high-frequency components of the dose map instead of the original dose map.

These approaches often emphasise only the most relevant features, overlooking the broader representational space, removing less important features. In this study, we propose a novel framework for explanation generation that serves as an alternative to feature removal, offering a more comprehensive understanding of model behaviour.

However, existing methods always treat reference frames uniformly and assign equal importance to all reference frames, which will lead to inpainting results that are too smooth to preserve necessary details and textures. For this purpose, we design a Deformable Spatio-Temporal Attention (DSTA) network, named DSTA-Net, to automatically learn to pay higher attention on specific reference frames. Concretely, our DSTA-Net begins by employing a lightweight motion estimator to predict coarse optical flows between target frame and reference frames. These coarse optical flows are employed as a basic offset rather than directly aligning reference frames. Subsequently, our proposed DSTA module calculates the sampling point offsets, attention maps, and flatten features with the aim of capturing the appropriate pixels from the regions with the highest similarity to the reference frames to generate the corrupted or missing contents. Numerous experimental results show that our method significantly outperform recent seven benchmarks on two most commonly-used datasets.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2024.3524099","Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province(grant numbers:2308085QF221); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62302006,12271002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10818585","Deformable spatio-temporal attention network;lightweight motion estimator;video inpainting","Optical signal processing;Feature extraction;Decoding;Benchmark testing;Stacking;Training;Measurement;Aggregates;Web sites;Video sequences","","","","39","IEEE","30 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although the most recent watermarking schemes with deep networks have exhibited considerable performance improvement, they still fall short in resisting multiple attacks with high-fidelity watermarking. To tackle this issue, a customized framework with encoder/decoder structure is proposed in this letter, aiming to consistently improve the robustness performance against multiple attacks. In specific, the Multi-scale Salient Feature Attention Block (MSFABlock) is exploited to effectively extract the robust image features with the encoder and decoder by taking advantage of the salient features, e.g., the image features obtained with difference of Gaussian (DoG) and other gradient operators. In addition, an adaptive squared Hinge function is developed as message loss to encourage adaptive watermark embedding.

To address this issue, this letter proposes an innovative Triple Matching (TriMatch) framework that integrates cross-modal (image-text) matching and unimodal (image-image, text-text) matching for high-precision person retrieval. The framework introduces a generation task that performs cross-modal (image-to-text and text-to-image) feature generation and intra-modal feature alig achieve unimodal matching. By incorporating the generation task, TriMatch considers not only the semantic correlations between modalities but also the semantic consistency within single modalities, thereby effectively enhancing the accuracy of target person retrieval.

Recent approaches based on deep neural networks achieve good depth denoising performance in synthetic data, but the application to real-world data is limited, due to the complexity of actual depth noise characteristics and the difficulty in acquiring ground truth. In this paper, we propose a novel ToF depth denoising network based on unrolled graph Laplacian regularization to ârobustifyâ the network against both noise complexity and dataset deficiency. Unlike previous schemes that are ignorant of underlying ToF imaging mechanism, we formulate a fidelity term in the optimization problem to adapt to the depth probabilistic distribution with spatially-varying noise variance. Then, we add quadratic graph Laplacian regularization as the smoothness prior, leading to a maximum a posteriori problem that is optimized efficiently by solving a linear system of equations. We unroll the solution into iterative filters so that parameters used in the optimization and graph construction are amendable to data-driven tuning. Because the resulting network is built using domain knowledge of ToF imaging principle and graph prior, it is robust against overfitting to synthetic training data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposal outperforms existing schemes in ToF depth denoising on synthetic FLAT dataset and generalizes well to real Kinectv2 dataset.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2025.3539908","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62201389); Shanghai Rising-Star Program(grant numbers:22YF1451200); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10878265","Depth denoising;time-of-flight sensor;graph signal processing;deep neural network","Noise;Noise reduction;Imaging;Optimization;Noise measurement;Laplace equations;Filters;Training;Phase measurement;Overfitting","","","","39","IEEE","7 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The coarse network identifies the positions and coarse segmentation outcomes of small objects in the input image. The fine network then takes a closer look at the small objects and re-segments the patches using binary segmentation. The fine network distinguishes small objects from the background to refine small object segmentation. Finally, C2FNet employs an aggregation module that merges the binary segmentation maps and coarse outcomes to obtain accurate small object segmentation. We conducted extensive experiments on three widely accepted datasets for remote sensing image segmentation, namely the ISPRS 2-D semantic labeling Potsdam, Vaihingen, and iSAID.

Traditional distillation, with two-stage training, is time-consuming and computationally expensive. Self-distillation methods can alleviate this deficiency by adopting a one-stage strategy. However, most of them lack a meticulously designed auxiliary network, resulting in the learned knowledge being simplistic and insufficient, which limits the ability of distillation. To address this challenge, we propose a training framework named deep-supervised Knowledge Enhancement Self-Distillation (KED) which organizes the teacher model hierarchically through stacking auxiliary classifiers after each shallow block to form the student models. Specifically, two modules, i.e., logit decouple distillation (LDD) and attention map generation (AT-Gen), are embedded in the framework to enhance the distillation knowledge. LDD divides the output of each classifier (logits) into target and non-target classes, making the knowledge from outputs more flexible and efficient. Moreover, AT-Gen extracts attention maps from the features of each block, emphasizing the knowledge from intermediate layers through attention maps' integration and interaction. Finally, knowledge from different sources works together to guide the training of the student models, compensating for the bias of the auxiliary networks. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2025.3540366","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52335001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10878504","Deep supervision;knowledge enhancement;self-distillation;model compression","Training;Computational modeling;Knowledge engineering;Feature extraction;Accuracy;Focusing;Data models;Data mining;Temperature distribution;Electronic mail","","","","28","IEEE","10 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Classical nonlinear filters, such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and particle filter (PF), often struggle to balance accuracy and computational cost in highly nonlinear models. Inspired by the property that data-driven methods trained offline in advance are generally efficient during inference phrase, we propose a physics-informed Data-driven Autoregressive nonlinear Filter (DAF) based on the Transformer architecture. During inference phrase, the DAF relies entirely on the neural network and does not retain any structure from classical nonlinear filters. Simulation results demonstrate that the DAF not only achieves higher accuracy than classical nonlinear filters without requiring access to ground-truth state values but also offers competitive computational efficiency.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2025.3541537","Taihu Lake Innovation Fund for Future Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10884033","Nonlinear filter;data-driven;physics-informed;transformer","Accuracy;Nonlinear filters;Training;Neural networks;Kalman filters;Transformers;Sun;Nonlinear systems;Gaussian distribution;Computational modeling","","1","","50","IEEE","13 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In practice, nodal heads are estimated at locations with no sensors. In this work, we propose an algorithm, termed mean percolation head reconstruction (MPHR), for estimating the nodal heads. The iterative algorithm is inspired by concepts from graph signal processing (GSP), and consists of two stages. The first stage is equivalent to the percolation of known values across the network, and the second stage performs some form of constrained consensus computations.

However, these methods frequently overlook the intrinsic information loss that occurs during the hash-coding process, as the hash layer performs two tasks simultaneously: spatial transformation and dimensionality reduction. Especially in multi-label image retrieval, the exponential increase in the number of combinations with the labels further amplifies the information loss in Hamming space. Consequently, the efficiency of the hash-coding is unsatisfactory. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce a novel approach termed WalshHash, which is grounded in the principles of Walsh transformation in signal processing. Unlike conventional techniques, WalshHash formulates the hash-coding layer as a filtering process based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in the Walsh domain accompanied by constraint loss functions on multiple domains. It ensures the dimensionality reduction in the Walsh domain can be effectively projected onto the real number domain with minimal information loss, because the Walsh space encapsulates the critical information components. As a result, WalshHash demonstrates superior performance in multi-label image retrieval compared to State-of-the-Art (SOTA) methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2025.3539246","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFB3602704); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10876618","Binary embedding;image retrieval;deep hashing","Image retrieval;Information filters;Filters;Codes;Vectors;Feature extraction;Dimensionality reduction;Low-pass filters;Training;Measurement","","2","","30","IEEE","6 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the most commonly used ICA algorithms is known as FastICA, which requires a spatial pre-whitening operation in the first step of the algorithm. Such a pre-whitening across all nodes of a WSN is impossible in a bandwidth-constrained distributed setting as it requires to correlate each channel with each other channel in the WSN. We show that an explicit network-wide pre-whitening step can be circumvented by leveraging the properties of the so-called Distributed Adaptive Signal Fusion (DASF) framework. Despite the lack of such a network-wide pre-whitening, we can still obtain the $Q$ least Gaussian independent components of the centralized ICA solution, where $Q$ scales linearly with the required communication load.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2025.3540370","European Research Council; European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme(grant numbers:802895,101138304); Research Foundation Flanders(grant numbers:G081722N); Flemish Government AI Research Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10878817","Distributed optimization;distributed spatial filtering;independent component analysis","Signal processing algorithms;Wireless sensor networks;Sensors;Distributed databases;Europe;Artificial intelligence;Sensor fusion;Optimization;Indexes;Fitting","","","","30","IEEE","10 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, we enhance the view-adaptive spherical harmonic (SH)-based Gaussian kernel to introduce anisotropy to the transparency field, enabling the Gaussian field to accurately represent smooth and specular reflective regions without compromising rendering speed. Furthermore, we extend the capabilities of this Gaussian kernel to incorporate rotation and scaling, facilitating the directional decoding of both properties at the same Gaussian position.

Random undersampling is then performed in the spatial domain, and the compressed signal is recovered using the observation signal and curvelet domain compressed sensing. Subsequently, the inverse operator is applied to restore the compressed signal to complete photoacoustic data. Finally, traditional photoacoustic reconstruction methods are combined for imaging.

The receiver can extract secret data from stego media without knowing who was the sender. Specifically, the stego media is produced by a number of individuals (including the sender and other normal individuals). Thus, the receiver cannot know who was the sender, since the media produced by the sender is only a part of stego media and the receiver cannot find the part produced by the sender from stego media. Therefore, the sender is anonymous during the whole process of steganography. That means this kind of steganography is untraceable. In this case, the sender's identity can be protected, and thus the security of steganography can be advanced in a higher level. A specific untraceable steganography scheme is designed in this paper for digital images, which achieves the function of untraceable steganography without decrease the undetectability of stego media.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2025.3543103","Chenguang Program of Shanghai Education Development Foundation and Shanghai Municipal Education Commission(grant numbers:22CGA46); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10891478","Digital images;steganography;untraceable","Media;Steganography;Costs;Receivers;Data mining;Mathematical models;Distortion;Information entropy;Digital images;Encoding","","","","20","IEEE","17 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous approaches to TTSLS aligned the phoneme sequence and video frames using scaled dot-product attention with a diagonal constraint loss, which was employed to prevent a phoneme from being assigned to video frames too far away. However, the diagonal constraint loss basically assumes that the duration of each phoneme is about the same, which is not always valid as speaking styles can be different. In this letter, we propose a TTSLS system based on speech-assisted text-to-video alignment and masked unit prediction. By utilizing the ground-truth speech signal available in the training phase, we construct a loss function for text-to-video alignment using the text-to-speech alignment obtained by a pre-trained TTS model. To deal with video frames without frontal lip images, we employ a masked unit prediction loss so that the unit predictor in the proposed system can estimate the masked units from the rest of the units. In addition, we modified the probability distribution for the unit predictor using a learnable null embedding for video inspired by classifier-free guidance.

It is shown that the weighted-SRV-based design outperforms the SRV-based design with mainlobe ripple and sidelobe level being able to be precisely controlled. However, the approximation error of reference beampattern in the weighted-SRV design may lead to slow convergence or even failure to converge.

Traditional approaches often rely on image restoration techniques to enhance the quality of degraded images prior to detection. However, these methods frequently struggle to balance image enhancement and detection tasks effectively, often overlooking latent information that could be beneficial for detection. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework: Knowledge Distillation based on Diffusion Models (KDDM). This framework incorporates a Dehaze Network (DN), which employs large kernel convolution to remove weather-specific artifacts, thereby revealing more latent information. The DN, together with a text detector, forms an end-to-end scene text detection network, acting as the student network. Additionally, the nuanced internal representations of text-to-image diffusion models adeptly capture and integrate higher-order visual semantic concepts. Given the rich textual and visual content inherent in scene text, there is a fundamental connection to text-to-image diffusion models. As such, we utilize diffusion models as a teacher network to distill high-level visual semantic knowledge into the student network. Notably, we introduce an innovative distillation technique using a âThreshold_Maskâ, which ensures that the student network focuses on text regions while minimizing interference from irrelevant background elements.

It aims to infer fine-grained flow maps from coarse-grained traffic data. However, existing methods face challenges due to the highly complex nature of spatial modeling for urban flow patterns and the distinctive impact of external factors such as temperature and weather. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Simplified Multi-Factor spatial modeling framework (SimMF) to enhance the accuracy of fine-grained flow inference while optimizing inference complexity. SimMF incorporates a dual-path architecture for short-range modeling, combining multi-scale convolutions and frequency-domain processing via FFT to capture cross-scale spatial correlations and heterogeneity. For long-range dependencies, SimMF employs enhanced bottleneck attention with linear complexity, effectively modeling intricate spatial relationships. Additionally, SimMF adopts a view-aware learnable approach to represent external factors, enabling each factor to generate distinctive feature maps and capture its unique characteristics. Experimental results on two urban datasets demonstrate that SimMF outperforms existing methods, achieving superior inference accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency with significantly improved computational efficiency.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2025.3539030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10873813","Urban flow inference;graph attention;traffic flow analysis;urban systems","Training;Frequency-domain analysis;Meteorology;Feature extraction;Correlation;Computational modeling;Vectors;Temperature;Traffic control;Temperature dependence","","","","32","IEEE","5 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Subsequently, a novel method for 3D point cloud map segmentation based on 2D features and 3D point clouds matching is introduced to expedite the transmission of point cloud maps. Finally, a relocalization and point cloud map updating method grounded in prior knowledge is proposed, facilitating seamless welding operations by HWR in routine maintenance scenes.

In this paper, we introduce BudSAM, a novel audio denoising model that incorporates the Segment Anything Model (SAM), originally designed for image segmentation task, into the field of visual bird sound denoising. By treating audio denoising as a segmentation task, BudSAM utilizes SAM's powerful segmentation capabilities and we incorporates BCE and Dice losses to enhance the model's ability to segment weak signals, effectively isolating the clean bird sounds that are often masked by background noise.

To address these issues, we propose a novel one-stream infrared and visible image fusion (OSFusion) framework that connects a source image pair to achieve bidirectional information flow. In this way, the fused features with cross-modal complementary information can be dynamically extracted by mutual guidance. To further improve the inference efficiency and obtain high-quality fused images, a feature extraction and fusion module (FEFM) is proposed based on Transformer structure. The combination of feature extraction and feature fusion is realized by using it. Since there is no need for an extra feature interaction module and the implementation is highly parallel, the speed of image fusion is extremely fast. Benefiting from the one-stream structure and FEFM, OSFusion achieves promising infrared and visible image fusion performance on MSRS, M3FD, and RoadScene datasets.

To address this problem, we will propose a new zero-shot low-light enhancement method to compensate for the lack of light and structural information in the diffusion sampling process by effectively combining the wavelet and Fourier frequency domains to construct rich a priori information. The key to the inspiration comes from the similarity between the wavelet and Fourier frequency domains: both light and structure information are closely related to specific frequency domain regions, respectively. Therefore, by transferring the diffusion process to the wavelet low-frequency domain and combining the wavelet and Fourier frequency domains by continuously decomposing them in the inverse process, the constructed rich illumination prior is utilised to guide the image generation enhancement process.

To address this, we reformulate the problem of detecting biomedical copy-move forgery regions as an intra-image co-saliency detection task and propose CMSeg-Net, a copy-move forgery segmentation network capable of identifying unseen duplicated areas.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) framework for IRSTD, denoted as IRSTD-SFDA. This framework comprises two key components: Multi-expert Domain Adaptation (MDA) and Multi-scale Focused Learning (MFL). MDA leverages the source model to generate pseudo masks for the target domain, facilitating the transfer of knowledge from the source to the target domain. To account for the inherent diversity of small targets across domains, MDA refines these pseudo masks through a series of operations, including target localization, rolling guidance filtering, shape adaptation, and multi-expert decision, thereby mitigating morphological discrepancies between the source and target domains. Meanwhile, MFL employs a global-local fusion strategy to focus on critical regions, enhancing the model's ability to detect small infrared targets.

Our approach incorporates depth information as the real part of the quaternion representations, leveraging the correlation between color and depth to improve the result of inpainting. In the proposed method, we first restore the observed image with the conventional LRQMC and estimate the depth of the restored result.

When $L$ is large, PSA still requires significant computational time to find all projection directions. In this letter, we find that the $(m+1)$th projection direction in PSA can be obtained by calculating the eigenvector of a tensor of size $(L-m)\times (L-m)\times (L-m)$. Furthermore, we propose a fast version of PSA (FastPSA) that is mathematically equivalent to PSA. The experimental results demonstrate that FastPSA has lower computational complexity than PSA.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2025.3546893","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:31400); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10908831","Feature extraction;FastICA;principal skewness analysis;hyperspectral image","Tensors;Principal component analysis;Feature extraction;Computational complexity;Vectors;Signal processing algorithms;Training;Hyperspectral imaging;Data mining;Computational efficiency","","","","20","IEEE","3 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, we design feature modulation blocks, which include the adaptive feature selection modulation (AFSM) module and the self-gating feed-forward network (SFN). The AFSM module dynamically computes the importance of each feature channel. For channels with differing levels of importance, we employ distinct processing strategies, thereby concentrating the computational resources of the network on the more critical features as much as possible. This approach facilitates the maintenance of a low computational cost without compromising performance. The SFN restricts the flow of irrelevant feature information within the network through a simple gating mechanism. In this way, our method achieves efficient and effective image super-resolution.

To address these issues, we proposed a strategy for multiple spatial explorations and designed Spatial Bi-Exploration Network (SPNet). SPNet conducts a comprehensive analysis of complex camouflage scenarios by jointly exploring depth spatial, contour spatial, and image feature information, thereby enhancing detection performance and maintaining robustness. Unlike existing methods, SPNet leverages dual exploration of depth and contour spaces to mitigate the vulnerability of coarse structures to noise. Depth spatial information aids the model in recognizing the deep relationships between objects and the background, reducing the impact of noise on object boundaries, while contour spatial information improves edge detection accuracy.

The key challenge for CAC is how to tailor a desirable interaction between exemplar and query features. Previous CAC methods implement such interaction by solely leveraging standard global feature convolution. We find this interaction leads to under-match caused by intra-class diversity and over-match on background, which harms counting performance severely. In this work, we propose a novel feature interaction method called Adaptive and Background-aware Match (ABM) against high intra-class diversity and noisy background. Concretely, given exemplar and query features, we improve the original high-dimensional coupled spaces match to Adaptive Orthogonal subspaces Match (AOM), avoiding under-match caused by intra-class diversity. Moreover, Background-Specific Match (BSM) employs interaction between the learnable background prototype and query features to provide global background priors, making the match be aware of background regions. Additionally, we find the high scale variance among different query images leads to bad counting performance for extremely small scale objects. Object-Scale Unify (OSU) is proposed to take the size of the exemplars as the scale prior and resize query images so that all objects are at a uniform average scale.

Consequently, we are unable to prepare a supervised training dataset in advance. This places higher demands on steganalysis algorithms, necessitating their ability to generalize and detect any unknown steganography domain. To this end, we propose a universal detection method for generative linguistic steganography based on heterogeneous domain remapping. The core idea is to employ a neural structure composed of pre-trained embedding layers and capsule networks to extract steganography-sensitive correlation features. Subsequently, the concept of contrastive learning is utilized to remap the sensitive features from heterogeneous steganography domains into a unified domain. This process effectively extracts domain-invariant features, thereby enabling the detection of unknown steganographic domains.

However, existing methods generate only a single image at a time for a given spike stream, which results in excessive redundant computations between consecutive frames when aiming at restoring a video clip, thereby increasing computational costs significantly.

Meanwhile, remarkable similarities between different person identities may lead to a mismatch between text and image. To tackle the two issues, we present a Visual-Language Noise Modeling (ViLNM) method that successfully captures robust cross-modal associations even with noise. Specifically, we design a Noise Token Aware (NTA) module that eliminates the words in the textual description that do not match the image, utilizing the matched words to establish a more reliable association. Besides, to enhance the recognition ability of the model for different person identities, we propose a Joint Inter and Intra-Modal Contrastive Loss (JII) and Local Aggregation (LA) module to increase the feature differences between different person identities.

In real-world scenarios, the cover text is far more abundant than the stego text, making it extremely difficult to obtain sufficient stego text for training. Furthermore, the scarcity of stego text also increases the difficulty of detection, posing greater challenges for steganalysis. In contrast, cover text is relatively easier to obtain in real-world scenarios, but current methods fail to fully utilize this resource. In this paper, we propose a Domain-Assisted Few-shot linguistic steganalysis method called DAF-Stega. To make full use of the cover text, we incorporate cover texts from multiple domains to assist in training. To address the scarcity of stego texts, we perform few-shot steganalysis based on a small amount of stego text and employ dynamic decision-making to generate pseudo-labels for self-training, enhancing model performance.

This attack aims to invalidate watermarking designed to detect art theft mimicry in text-to-image models. In this method, a watermark recognition network and a watermark removal network are designed. The watermark recognition network identifies whether an artwork contains watermark, and the watermark removal network is used to remove it. Consequently, text-to-image models fine-tuned with watermark-removed artworks can reproduce an artist's style while evading watermark detection. This makes the copyright authentication of artworks ineffective. Experiments show that the proposed attack can effectively remove watermarks, with watermark extraction accuracy dropping below 48.64%.

Moreover, advanced techniques like compressed sensing and machine learning are constrained by requirements for high signal sparsity or suffer from limited generality. To handle these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative extension of subspace theory tailored to insufficient-snapshot scenarios, leveraging the concept of spatio-temporal exchangeability. Based on the defined spatio-temporal correlation predicated on the space translation invariance characteristic of uniform linear arrays, we engineer a pseudo SCM that inherently possesses sufficient rank.

Recently, code-switching natural language processing and automatic speech recognition (ASR) have attracted numerous studies. However, a major obstacle affecting the results of these studies is the lack of transcribed data. In this letter, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach to deal with this problem, namely Mutual Learning-Based Semi-Supervised Method (MLSS). The MLSS method involves the utilization of two networks for interleaved fine-tuning on a combination of transcribed dataset and pseudo-labeled data generated from another network. This iterative fine-tuning process repeats until all unlabeled data are selected for training or reaches a certain number of iterations. By incorporating mutual learning between the two networks, our approach effectively leverages the knowledge acquired from previous iterations during the training stage and combines the knowledge from both networks during the decoding process, resulting in a more robust and effective approach. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct experiments on the SEAME Mandarin-English code-switching corpus.

Nevertheless, owing to the complex distribution of anomalous regions and the similarity in spatial-spectral features, these models often reconstruct anomalies and backgrounds simultaneously, hindering their ability to distinguish between them and reducing detection accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a novel hyperspectral anomaly detection method based on a spatial-spectral joint mask variational autoencoder (VAE). By combining the probabilistic modeling capabilities of VAEs with a masking-based attention mechanism, our method enables more precise extraction of essential background information in localized regions.

Some Transformer-based methods acquire attention maps within channel dimension, whereas the spatial resolutions of queries and keys involved in matrix multiplication are much larger than the dimensions of channels. During the key-query dot-product interaction to generate attention maps, massive information redundancy and expensive computational costs are incurred. Simultaneously, most previous feed-forward networks in Transformers do not model the multi-range information that plays an important role for feature reconstruction. Based on the above observations, we propose an effective Multi-Scale Downsampling-Based Transformer (MDFormer) for low-light image enhancement, which consists of multi-scale downsampling-based self-attention (MDSA) and multi-range gated extraction block (MGEB). MDSA employs downsampling with two different factors for queries and keys to save the computational cost when implementing self-attention operations within channel dimension. Furthermore, we introduce learnable parameters for the two generated attention maps to adjust the weights for fusion, which allows MDSA to adaptively retain the most significant attention scores from attention maps. The proposed MGEB captures multi-range information by virtue of the multi-scale depth-wise convolutions and dilated convolutions, to enhance modeling capabilities.

However, since learnable queries are primarily determined by the distribution of training samples, discriminative characteristics of the input image often have been disregarded. In this letter, we propose a novel clustering-based query generation method for semantic segmentation. The key idea of the proposed method is to adaptively generate queries based on the clustering scheme, which leverages semantic affinities in the latent space. By aggregating latent features that represent the same class in a given input, the semantic information of each class can be efficiently encoded into the query. Furthermore, we propose to apply the auxiliary loss function to predict the segmentation result in a coarse scale during the process of query generation. This enables each query to grasp spatial information of the target object in a given image.

Moreover, graph-based methods do not adequately address the challenges of overlapping clusters or ambiguous cluster membership. Additionally, assigning appropriate weights based on the importance of each view is crucial. To address these problems, we propose a self-weighted multi-view fuzzy clustering algorithm that incorporates multiple graph learning.

To this end, this paper proposes a color screen content image hashing algorithm using adaptive text regions features and global shape features. Specifically, the text regions are adaptively collected by calculating the local standard deviation of sub-blocks. Then, quaternion Fourier significant maps are computed for the text regions, and texture statistical features are further extracted to reflect the essential visual content robustness. Moreover, the global shape features are represented from the entire color SCI to ensure the discrimination. Finally, the hash sequence with a length of 142 bits is derived from the above features.

One elegant and effective approach is to exploit the eigendecomposition of a graph shift operator (GSO), such as the adjacency or Laplacian operator, to define a graph Fourier transform for projecting graph signals on the corresponding basis. However, the extension of this scheme to directed graphs is challenging since the associated GSO is non-symmetric and, in general, not diagonalizable. Here, we build upon a recent framework that adds a minimal number of edges to allow diagonalization of the GSO and thus provide a proper graph Fourier transform. Furthermore, we show that such minimal addition of edges creates a cycle cover and that it is essential for the phase analysis of a signal throughout the graph. Concurrently, we propose a generalization of the Hilbert transform interpreted over the newfound cycle cover, which re-establishes intuitions from traditional Hilbert transform, equivalent to the generalized Hilbert transform on a single cycle. This generalization leads to a number of simple and elegant recipes to effectively exploit the phase information of graph signals provided by the graph Fourier transform. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated on several examples.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2025.3560170","Swiss National Science Foundation, Sinergia(grant numbers:209470); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10962535","Graph signal processing;harmonic analysis;Hilbert transform;directed graph","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Fans;Directed graphs;Symmetric matrices;Signal processing;Perturbation methods;Vectors;Laplace equations;Boundary conditions;Training","","","","32","IEEE","11 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address these challenges, we proposed a Contrastive Semantic-aware Masked Autoencoder (Point-CSMAE), which is equipped with a semantic-aware masking (SAM) strategy and a contrastive regularization (CR) mechanism. Specifically, the semantic-aware masking strategy adaptively selects patches with richer semantic information for masking and reconstruction, enhancing the understanding of global geometric structure. Furthermore, the contrastive regularization mechanism adaptively aligns the global information between the masked and visible parts, thus improving the learned global semantic representation.

However, carotid plaques exhibit complex and diverse shapes, with blurry and irregular boundaries, making this task very challenging. This paper proposes a novel Boundary-Supplementary Network (BSNet) for carotid plaque segmentation. BSNet follows an encoder-decoder structure and incorporates two essential modules: the Multi-Scale Attention Module (MSAM) and the Boundary-Supplementary Module (BSM). MSAM is deployed at each layer to comprehensively analyze the feature at different spatial scales and dynamically fuse multi-scale features using the attention mechanism. It aids the network in better recognizing carotid plaques with irregular shapes. BSM incorporates the outputs of the MSAM at the current and adjacent high layer with the prediction map of the adjacent high layer to enhance boundary regions. Through top-down deep supervision, BSNet can accurately localize the carotid plaque regions with clear boundaries. Extensive experiments on a collected dataset demonstrate that BSNet outperforms 8 state-of-the-art methods in carotid plaque segmentation.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2025.3560583","Shenzhen Medical Research(grant numbers:A2403035); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62371305); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LGF22H180006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10964270","Deep neural network;carotid plaque segmentation;multi-scale attention;boundary-supplementary;ultrasound images","Image segmentation;Ultrasonic imaging;Shape;Biomedical imaging;Convolution;Training;Silicon;Accuracy;Image resolution;Feature extraction","","","","30","IEEE","14 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Subsequent decisions combine the advantages of monotonic and Vcm-based switching schemes, requiring only a single capacitor switch for each bit, simultaneously reducing the reference voltage shifting by half. The proposed switching scheme reduces capacitance distribution from â20C, $\ldots,$ 2N-1Câ to â20C, $\ldots,$ 2N-3C,â which reduces the capacitance spread and thereby relaxes the capacitor matching requirements.

To address this issue, this letter proposes a moving target coherent integration method based on time reverse conjugate multiply and keystone transform (TRCM-KT) for UAV-mounted through-the-wall radar. In the proposed method, the reference signal is constructed by azimuthal time reverse and conjugation. Then, by multiplying the echo signal and the reference signal, the second-order range migration and doppler phase terms are eliminated. Next, keystone transform is employed to correct the remained first-order range migration. Finally, the fully coherent integration results can be obtained by performing Fourier transform along the azimuth direction.

Through a reexamination of the intrinsic properties of Mamba, we observe that it is fundamentally a first-order function and leveraging this insight, we introduce a high-order variant of Mamba, wherein the linear complexity attention mechanism within the initial Mamba is shared across successive Mamba calculations, achieving the same functionality while mitigating the computational cost of stacked methods.

Specifically, our LMAE utilizes masks to cover intermediate-level features of one modality based on the prediction hierarchy of another modality, and then distills cross-modality guidance information through regularization constraints. This strategy, through a self-learning paradigm, effectively preserves the useful information from both modalities while eliminating redundant information from each. Finally, the fused features are input into an uncertainty-based detection head to generate predictions for bounding boxes of vehicles.

In this letter, we investigate a power minimization-based secure beamforming problem for a multiple-input single-output VLC system having both LoS and NLoS components. Assuming perfect channel state information (CSI), we formulate an optimal secure beamforming problem with a worst-case secrecy rate constraint and a per-lamp power constraint. Instead of removing the rank-one constraint, we incorporate such a constraint into the objective function and treat it as a penalty term. Then, we propose a semidefinite programming and penalty function (SDPPF) algorithm to solve the non-convex problem. To enhance practicality, we also consider the case of imperfect CSI and explore a robust beamforming scheme.

In particular, we employ the anchor-based multi-view similarity learning to capture the consensus manifold structure latent in multiple views, thereby constructing a unified bipartite graph with adaptive anchor learning and view weighting. Then we impose a low-rank constraint on the bipartite graph structure to directly reveal the desired number of clusters without additional post-processing. An efficient alternating minimization algorithm is developed to optimize the model, resulting in a computational complexity that scales linearly with the number of samples.

Addressing the limitations of existing methods, such as the sub-gradient approach, which fails to distinguish between active and non-active coefficients effectively, this paper introduces the decentralized smoothing alternating direction method of multipliers (DSAD) for penalized quantile regression. Our method leverages non-convex sparse penalties like the minimax concave penalty (MCP) and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), improving the identification and retention of significant predictors. DSAD incorporates a total variation norm within a smoothing ADMM framework, achieving consensus among distributed nodes and ensuring uniform model performance across disparate data sources. This approach overcomes traditional convergence challenges associated with non-convex penalties in decentralized settings. We present convergence proof and extensive simulation results to validate the effectiveness of the DSAD, demonstrating its superiority in achieving reliable convergence and enhancing estimation accuracy compared with prior methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2025.3562828","Research Council of Norway and the Research Council of Finland(grant numbers:354523); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10971234","Distributed learning;non-convex and non-smooth sparse penalties;quantile regression;weak convexity","Smoothing methods;Convergence;Accuracy;Vectors;Optimization;Estimation;Transforms;Training;Predictive models;Distributed databases","","","","30","IEEE","21 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Its countermeasure, commonly known as the QIM-based VoIP steganalysis, has been one of the research hotspots over the past decades. VoIP speech data is sequential, so most previous studies have focused on the temporal features extracted from VoIP encoding codewords to improve detection accuracy. As a result, spatial features are often ignored or fully investigated. In practice, VoIP speech data has unique spatial characteristics. Spatial features could capture the properties of nearby codewords and frames. Inspired by the success of CLIP (contrastive languageâimage pre-training), we propose a novel model that could efficiently incorporate spatial and temporal features named CAST (contrastive analysis of spatial and temporal features). CLIP introduces the concept of contrastive languageâimage learning, which has demonstrated exceptional efficiency and effectiveness in aligning textual and visual representations. However, it is not directly applicable to the field of QIM-based VoIP steganalysis. In CAST, we introduce a way to align spatial and temporal features through contrastive analysis.

Consequently, heuristic methods, notably including the block orthogonal matching pursuit (BOMP), have been used in the multistatic radar context to approach the ML estimation greedily. Interestingly, the more accurate block orthogonal least squares (BOLS) method has not been studied in this context because the performance improvement is usually low in regard to its computational complexity.

Existing methods directly blend depth features with RGB features. However, they often overlook that, in depth maps, the low contrast of neighboring objects affects salient regions that do not correspond to the saliency regions in the RGB image, leading to unsatisfactory results. We design a novel network called saliency-aided aggregation consensus network (SACNet) for RGB-D co-salient object detection. SACNet incorporates two key modules: the multimodal weight-sharing fusion and feature consensus aggregation module. The multimodal weight-sharing fusion effectively integrates RGB and depth modal information by calibrating depth features and sharing weights, which helps extract feature consensus. The feature consensus aggregation module clusters information in individual image saliency for inference, distinguishing between co-salient and non-co-salient objects, and aggregates consensus features across the image group. To enhance the discriminative power of the consensus representation, individual image saliency information is stored and updated in a queue. SACNet achieved competitive results on two challenging benchmark datasets.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2025.3567027","Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:ZCLZ25F0202); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62371422); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10985763","Clustering;feature consensus;modal fusion;RGB-D co-salient object detection","Feature extraction;Object detection;Data mining;Correlation;Training;Prototypes;Noise;Interference;Decoding;Convolution","","","","27","IEEE","5 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, this paper proposes a Frequency Domain-Based Cross-layer Feature Aggregation Network (FCFANet), aiming to improve the problems of multi-target omission, small target loss, object localization deviation, and insufficient segmentation accuracy in complex scenes. FCFANet mainly consists of an Intra- and Inter-layer Enhancement Module (IEM) and a Frequency-Spatial Interaction Fusion Module (FSIFM). IEM reduces noise and enhances the feature representation, while FSIFM extracts frequency information, and enhances feature discrimination by complementary fusion of spatial and frequency domains, thus realizing the precise positioning and high-precision segmentation of camouflaged objects.

Existing intra-class multimodal representation methods employ sub-centers to capture intra-class variations. However, these sub-center methods have some limitations, i.e., they ignore the relationship between sub-centers and do not ensure the diversity of sub-centers. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-center classifier. Different from the vanilla multi-center classifier, our proposal is established on the assumption that the deep features of the training set follow a Gaussian Mixture distribution. Specifically, we create a conditional Gaussian distribution for each class and then sample multiple sub-centers from that distribution to extend the linear classifier. This approach allows the model to capture intra-class local structures more efficiently. In addition, we propose a novel label assignment strategy, the Multi-Center Class Label, to ensure that each sub-center is effectively involved in the training.

Firstly, the relationship between recognition and decoding is analyzed, and the erroneous codewords to be decoded can be selected by analyzing the spectrogram obtained from recognition; Then, the $\eta$-dynamically adjustable multiplicity assignment ($\eta$-DAMA) algorithm is proposed by analyzing the channel soft information, where $\eta$ is the number of the most unreliable code positions.

The development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer has greatly advanced this field. Most existing transformer-based trackers focus on global modeling while neglecting the utilization of local information. In this paper, we propose a novel Convolutional Attention Fusion Module (CAFM) for RGBT target tracking. To be specific, this module continuously slides local windows on the image like convolution, and captures context features in each window like attention. Additionally, local position embedding is added to the window and works in conjunction with global position embedding to enhance the model's understanding of spatial information. Therefore, our CAFM enhances the extraction of local features by restricting the attention area and promotes multimodal fusion through cross-attention. We extend OSTrack to RGBT tracking and integrate the proposed CAFM into it. Experimental results show that our method performs well on the LasHeR, RGBT210, and RGBT234 datasets, and is superior to other advanced trackers.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2025.3569477","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62402449,62272419); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LQ23F020010); Open Project Program of the State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG(grant numbers:A2421); Jinhua Science and Technology Project(grant numbers:2023-4-016); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11002497","RGBT target tracking;convolution;attention;local features;multimodal fusion","Feature extraction;Convolution;Target tracking;Transformers;Computational modeling;Training;Data mining;Computational efficiency;Electronic mail;Artificial intelligence","","1","","37","IEEE","12 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address these issues, we propose UniArray, a novel approach that abandons the conventional interleaving manner.

Since the number of coherent DFT measurements is equal to the number of radio frequency (RF) chains that is much smaller than the number of antennas, only a small spatial region can be scanned coherently. The number of coherent measurements can be increased by generating virtual RF chains through time-domain-multiplexed (TDM) measurements. However, due to hardware imperfections, random phase jump errors between the TDM measurements degrade the direction of arrival (DoA) estimation accuracy. This paper proposes a new 2-dimensional (2-D) beamspace phase noise parameter compensation (PNPC) algorithm, called 2-D PNPC-DFT-ESPRIT, which jointly estimates the random phase jump errors and the DoAs for uniform rectangular arrays (URAs). The 2-D PNPC-DFT-ESPRIT algorithm modifies the beamspace shift invariance equations for URAs, which consider the contributions of the random phase jump errors and the DoAs. An iterative procedure is developed to estimate both jointly.

To this end, a gated multi-scale module (GMM) is proposed to enrich and strengthen feature representations by collecting multi-scale features with less computational cost using a set of parallel depthwise convolutions, and customizing the gated convolution (GConv) for RDH to weight the importance of features in channel and spatial dimensions. Considering that directly utilizing the addition or concatenation operations cannot better fuse two types of features with different receptive fields, a gated feature fusion and refinement module (GFFRM) is tailored to employ the standard convolutions of different sizes to shorten the receptive field differences between deep and shallow features. GFFRM also constructs depthwise separable convolution followed by GConv to enrich and refine the expression of features at low computational cost and enhance the information exchange across channel and spatial dimensions, thereby improving the fusion effect of features at different levels. A two-path multi-dimensional feature interaction module (MFIM) is designed, where one branch utilizes a pointwise convolution to obtain low-dimensional representations of features, whereas the other branch fuse two linearly transformed features through element-wise multiplication constructs to generate implicit high-dimensional features.

To address this fundamental limitation, an innovative framework is proposed in this letter, wherein the radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) are uniformly deployed at each node, serving as universal approximators for various noise profiles. Leveraging this framework, a recursive-type diffusion algorithm is introduced to achieve enhanced network-wide performance.

The diffusion term reduces the stiffness of the differential equation and makes it possible to perform PFl with a lower number of numerical integration steps compared to traditional deterministic PFl. In this work, we introduce a general approach to perform importance sampling (IS) based on stochastic PFl. Our method makes it possible to evaluate a âflow-inducedâ proposal probability density function (PDF) after the parameters of the prior/predicted PDF represented by Gaussian mixture model (GMM) have been migrated by stochastic PFl. Compared to conventional stochastic PFl, the resulting processing step is asymptotically optimal.

Most existing TSE models rely on discriminative methods, typically predicting a time-frequency spectrogram mask for the target speech. However, imperfections in these masks often result in over-/under-suppression of target/non-target speech, degrading perceptual quality. Generative methods, by contrast, re-synthesize target speech based on the mixture and target speaker cues, achieving superior perceptual quality. Nevertheless, these methods often overlook speech intelligibility, leading to alterations or loss of semantic content in the re-synthesized speech. Inspired by the Whisper modelâs success in target speaker ASR, we propose a generative TSE framework based on the pre-trained Whisper model to address the above issues.

However, the virtual array remains susceptible to MC. To handle this problem, in this letter, a general synthetic signal model with MC is derived and an iterative method on the array configuration is proposed to form a virtual array with less MC for the circular motion-based DOA estimation. Specifically, a virtual uniform concentric circular array (VUCCA) is constructed by synthesizing all the observations at different time delays with uniform spacing, and the equation between MC matrix of the VUCCA and the initial array is derived, proving that the MC of VUCCA is solely related to the configuration of initial array.

The primary goal is not to compete with state-of-the-art deep learning-based enhancement methods but to produce intermediate images that can serve as effective labels for training self-supervised models without requiring ground-truth datasets. By dynamically fusing MSR and AHE outputs with the original image using adaptive brightness and color weights, the method improves structural integrity while enhancing brightness and color consistency. Experiments on standard low-light datasets demonstrate significant improvements in PSNR and SSIM compared to traditional enhancement methods. However, a visual analysis of the generated labels reveals differences in color saturation when compared to ground truth, providing insights into designing a suitable loss function for future self-supervised learning applications. It is important to note that this work does not include experiments or methods related to self-supervised learning itself; instead, it focuses on preparing high-quality labels for such approaches.

The proposed approach divides the hyperspectral image into two sub-images, comprising two distinct groups of bands: a base image consisting of anchor bands and a supplementary image comprising non-anchor bands. The base image is compressed losslessly using a conventional codec, thereby ensuring the preservation of essential information. In contrast, the supplementary image is compressed efficiently by overfitting a lightweight super-resolution network to predict the non-anchor bands during encoding. The optimized network parameters are encoded as side information to ensure high-quality spectral super-resolution during decoding.

In this model, each input is confined within the envelope region, and the mean-square-error matrix of the input, which contains the first and second moments of the pdf, is used as the covariance of the process noise. Based on this model, a joint tracking and classification approach is proposed. In this approach, class-based tracking can be performed efficiently using the best-model-augmentation algorithm, where each candidate model is assumed to be a CP-VAI model and a class-based model-set-adaptation method is developed to select the best model for tracking. For Bayesian classification, the likelihood function of the best model can be used as that of the class. The proposed approach naturally integrates the probabilistic FE through the CP-VAI model and has an analytical form. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2025.3576060","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U23B2035,62273269); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11021387","Joint tracking and classification;probabilistic flight envelope;kinematic measurements","Iron;Probabilistic logic;Kinematics;Computational modeling;Adaptation models;Target tracking;Probability density function;Noise;Sensors;Covariance matrices","","","","36","IEEE","2 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Infrared images of PV modules can be used to classify these defects, as each type of defect images has different spatial characteristics. This paper presents a novel approach to classifying infrared images of PV modules based on the modern convolutional neural network architecture, ConvNeXt. Many previous studies have initialized models using ImageNet pre-trained weights to deal with PV module datasets containing a small number of training images. However, this requires resizing the images in the PV module dataset (24 Ã 40) to the size used for ImageNet pre-training (224 Ã 224), which significantly increases floating point operations for both training and inference. To address the problem, we propose a task-specific pre-training procedure that does not rely on external datasets such as ImageNet, thereby can avoid excessive increase in image size. We also introduce attention mechanisms into the ConvNeXt block to further improve classification performance. Experimental results on the PV module dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive performance in classifying multiple types of defects with fewer floating point operations than conventional approaches, offering a computationally efficient and fast solution for PV plant monitoring systems.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2025.3577121","Chosun University through research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11026792","Photovoltaic module;convolutional neural network;transfer learning;pre-training","Training;Mixers;Feature extraction;Data models;Computer architecture;Transformers;Kernel;Decoding;Convolutional neural networks;Computational modeling","","1","","33","IEEE","5 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the relativeness of PCC, we rectify PCC to absolutize it. To be specific, we relax the denominator of PCC based on the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means to enforce unit scale, and add an extra modulation factor to further enforce zero location.

However, this increased connectivity also introduces significant complexity in evaluating the performance of consensus algorithms, since key metrics are typically defined in terms of Laplacian eigenvalues. Especially, estimating the largest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix remains a major challenge for the $r$-nearest neighbor ring networks. We reformulate the maximization of Laplacian eigenvalue as a minimization of the Dirichlet kernel problem. Firstly, we prove that the first and last lobes of the Dirichlet kernel are the deepest using the shift approach. Next, we apply local smoothness analysis and integer rounding arguments to demonstrate that there is at least one discrete sample to achieve a global minimum in that lobe. This study presents a rigorous analysis to precisely locate and compute the largest eigenvalue, resulting in exact analysis for key performance metrics, including convergence time, first-order network coherence, second-order network coherence, and maximum communication delay, with reduced computational complexity.

Although existing BSR models have achieved remarkable results, they often demand significant computational resources to manage various degradation kernels. Recent studies have utilized large models with parameter counts ranging from 4 M to 20 M, resulting in computational costs exceeding 200 G Multi-Adds. In this paper, we introduce a blind super-resolution method, which is the first lightweight non-iterative approach for BSR. By leveraging the connection between degradation kernel shapes and the frequency-domain characteristics of low-resolution images, we simplify the kernel estimation process, thereby reducing the overall model complexity.

Among them, quantization index modulation (QIM)-based VoIP steganography has demonstrated excellent stealth, making detection difficult. In recent years, more studies have focused on developing feasible QIM-based VoIP steganalysis methods for detecting QIM-based VoIP steganography. Previous studies have mostly focused on improving detection performance while neglecting efficiency, resulting in insufficient research on lightweight models. In online detection scenarios, detection efficiency is crucial. On the one hand, the long inference time of large models can delay warnings. On the other hand, the high computational requirements of these models make them difficult to deploy on remote devices, which reduces their practical value. In this letter, we propose a simple yet efficient model named EQVS (efficient QIM-based VoIP steganalysis network) for detecting QIM-based VoIP steganography. In EQVS, the fold and unfold operations are redesigned based on the characteristics of VoIP speech samples and the requirements of the QIM-based VoIP steganalysis task, to avoid disrupting correlation features. Then, multi-codeword priority attention mechanism, inspired by the multi-query attention and retention mechanisms, redefines the calculation procedure for the query, key, and value matrices, as well as the normalization and softmax operations, to further reduce computational resource consumption in a single attention head. Experimental results demonstrate that EQVS outperforms other state-of-the-art models in both detection performance and efficiency.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2025.3580496","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61673384); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11039055","VoIP steganalysis;adjacent frame;codeword priority;multi-codeword attention;lightweight models","Correlation;Feature extraction;Steganography;Computational modeling;Attention mechanisms;Bayes methods;Speech coding;Convolutional neural networks;Mathematical models;Indexes","","","","27","IEEE","17 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To ensure the reliability of DNNs, it is crucial to repair backdoored models, ensuring all samples, including poisoned ones, are correctly predicted. Existing backdoor repair methods rely on recovering a universal trigger, which degrades the model performance on clean data and fails against sophisticated attacks. In this paper, we propose FixGuard, a novel backdoor repair method based on a min-min optimization formulation. FixGuard consists of two main stages: the trigger recovery stage and the backdoor unlearning stage. In the trigger recovery stage, FixGuard recovers a semantic-aware trigger for each class. Compared to using a universal trigger, class-wise triggers can identify malicious patterns more precisely while avoiding excessively large triggers that degrade model performance on clean data. In the backdoor unlearning stage, FixGuard generates synthesized poisoned samples by patching clean images with the recovered triggers while preserving their correct labels. Subsequently, it trains backdoored models on these synthesized samples to sever the malicious connection between triggers and target labels. Experimental results demonstrate that FixGuard effectively mitigates backdoor threats while preserving model performance.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2025.3572409","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071142); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11009171","Deep neural networks;machine learning;backdoor attack;backdoor defense;model repair","Optimization;Maintenance engineering;Training;Predictive models;Data models;Semantics;Perturbation methods;Dogs;Training data;Toxicology","","","","52","IEEE","22 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the efficient integration of local and global features from multiple modalities to improve the robustness of segmentation model remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a multiscale cross-modal fusion network (MCFNet) for semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images. This model employs a symmetrical dual-CNN encoder and a lightweight MLP decoder to learn comprehensive feature representation across diverse modalities. Specifically, to refine modality features at different stages, we construct a feature fusion module (FFM) that fuses rich complementary information by gradually aggregating local and global features. Additionally, a multiscale cross-modal feature correlation module (MCFCM) is introduced to deeply capture and correlate interactive feature information from the fused features. Finally, an efficient multiscale enhancement module (MEM) is leveraged to further enhance multiscale information extraction. Extensive comparison experiments on two benchmark datasets reveal that our method obtains superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2025.3585827","Changsha Municipal Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:kq2208236); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11068147","CNN;multiscale cross-modal fusion;remote sensing image;semantic segmentation","Feature extraction;Remote sensing;Semantic segmentation;Convolution;Training;Micromechanical devices;Decoding;Data mining;Correlation;Spatial resolution","","","","17","IEEE","3 Jul 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a simple non-invasive physiological signal modality, that can be used to examine the electrical activity of heart tissue. Existing methods for MCI detection mostly rely on the temporal, frequency, and spatial domain analysis of the ECG signals. These conventional techniques lack in effective identification of cardiac cycle inter-dependency during diagnosis. Hence, there is an emerging need for incorporating the underlying connectivity of the intra-sessional cardiac cycles for improved anomaly detection. To address this gap, this article proposes a Topological Signal Processing (TSP) based novel framework for ECG signal analysis and classification. Persistent homological features have been extracted through Äech Complex generation with homotopy equivalence check. Homological features like persistent birth-death rates, Betti curves, and persistent entropy provide transparency of the regional and cardiac cycle connectivity when combined with Machine Learning (ML) models. The proposed framework is assessed using publicly available datasets (MIT-BIH and PTB), and the performance metrics of machine learning models indicate its efficacy in classifying Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR), MCI, and non-MCI subjects, achieving a 2.8% mean improvement in AUC (area under the ROC curve) over existing approaches.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2025.3586189","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11071635","Electrocardiogram (ECG);Äech complex;homotopy equivalence;topological signal processing","Electrocardiography;Feature extraction;Point cloud compression;Entropy;Anomaly detection;Support vector machines;Random forests;Myocardium;Heart;Biomedical monitoring","","","","33","IEEE","4 Jul 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To overcome these limitations, we propose a self-boosted weight-constrained filtered-reference least mean square (SB-WCFxLMS) algorithm for the distributed MCANC system without internode communication.

Diarization provides a binary indication of whether a speaker is active within a given time frame, whereas speech separation produces individual audio signals, each containing the isolated speech of a specific speaker. Recently, there has been growing interest in approaches that unify diarization and speech separation, particularly those leveraging neural models trained jointly to enhance performance in both tasks. In this letter, we propose a single neural model for joint speaker diarization and speech separation. Our model estimates speaker representations using a non-autoregressive attractor generation mechanism integrated into a modified SepFormer model. We present two variants of the model, designed for scenarios with sparse or highly overlapping speech, which achieve relative improvements of 51% for both separation and diarization over state-of-the-art methods, as evaluated on the LibriMix, LibriheavyMix and CALLHOME datasets.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2025.3590325","National Science Centre, Poland(grant numbers:2021/42/E/ST7/00452); AGH University of Krakow; Excellence initiative â research university; Polish high-performance computing infrastructure PLGrid(grant numbers:PLG/2023/016823,PLG/2024/017659); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11083894","Attractor mechanism;clustering;end-to-end;non-autoregressive model;speaker diarization;speech separation","Recording;Training;Estimation;Transformers;Computational modeling;Voice activity detection;Time-frequency analysis;Speech enhancement;Particle separators;Filters","","","","22","CCBY","18 Jul 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our approach enhances the vanilla SAM2 decoder with specialized frequency-aware modules to improve the performance on PCD.

The Multi-Scale Extraction (MSE) module is leveraged to capture rich multi-scale information, after which the features from the last three encoder layers are fused through a Cross-Layer Aggregation (CLA) module to obtain the aggregated high-level semantic features. A Semantic Gap Reduction (SGR) module is further proposed to bridge the semantic gap between high-level and shallow features during fusion.

To alleviate the problem, this letter proposes a four-stage steganalyzer, named ICSNet. The first three stages concentrate on generating a labeled intermediate domain to build a bridge between source/target domains. To be specific, the labeled intermediate domain is constructed by first adding the noise to target samples using a noise adding module to generate intermediate samples following the source domain distribution, and subsequently performing data embedding to these intermediate samples to generate the stego intermediate samples. The last stage focuses on strengthening the fusion of channel-wise and spatial correlations between source/target domains by presenting a coarse-to-fine two-domain channel-wise correlation fusion (CCF) module and a source-guided two-domain spatial correlation fusion (SCF) module. In CCF, the labeled intermediate domain works as a supplementary to the target domain, so that source/target domains can guide each other to reinforce the fusion of channel-wise correlations. In SCF, the labeled source domain guides the target domain to consolidate the fusion of spatial correlations. The four stages work together to reduce the distribution shift between source/target domains, thereby bringing performance improvement.

To tackle this issue, a secure and lightweight scheme based on partially homomorphic encryption is presented in this letter. Specifically, the least-squares estimation algorithm is decomposed into a form matching the additive homomorphism, so that each participated anchor can individually perform the encryption of its respective location-related information without interacting with others. During the entire localization process, private information of all entities involved remains secret, which could motivate users who have just done the positioning to participate in the localization, acting as pseudo-anchors for cooperative localization to solve the problem of dense anchor deployment.

However, current Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based speech recognition performance remains inadequate for practical applications, primarily due to two challenges. One is the involvement of multiple brain networks in speech production, which renders single-domain features insufficient for comprehensive representation; the other is the low signal-to-noise ratio inherent in EEG data, coupled with variable data quality, which complicates decoding efforts. To address both issues, we propose an adaptive multi-granularity information exploration (AMIE) model for enhancing EEG-based speech decoding performance, which leverages complementary information across multiple feature domains and incorporates a tripartite dynamic weighting mechanism, taking all the domain, sample and feature importance into consideration, to improve model robustness and emphasize discriminative features.

In view of this, this letter proposes a method called spatial coverage maximization-based exemplar replay (SCMER) to achieve class incremental SAR target recognition. First, a spatial coverage maximization-based exemplar selection is proposed, which resorts to hierarchical clustering method to partition the feature space and selects exemplars from old categories through different criteria in the hierarchical space. Then, a categories relationship constraints-based knowledge recall mechanism is developed to recall knowledge from selected exemplars as much as possible to alleviate catastrophic forgetting.

The image owner first predicts the pixel values of the cover image using EDP algorithm and calculates the prediction errors. After computing the prediction errors, the optimal thresholds are adaptively determined by minimizing the expected codeword length through entropy coding theory. Using these optimized thresholds, the prediction errors are classified into separate or grouped encoding categories, and losslessly compressed via arithmetic encoding. Through the processes of image encryption and self-embedding, an encrypted image with embedding room is generated and subsequently uploaded to the cloud server. The data hider can easily locate the data embedding room in the encrypted domain of the image and embed encrypted additional data to obtain the marked encrypted image. The authorized recipient can correctly extract the embedded data, restore the original plaintext image without any loss, or do both.

This letter devises a robust approach to improve the performance in such scenarios. Unlike traditional algorithms that use an identity matrix as the measurement noise weight matrix, the suggested method designs a strategy to update the weight matrix during iteration for outlier resistance. Specifically, we apply the penalty technique to optimize the weight matrix and thus formulate the imaging task as a half-quadratic optimization problem. In addition, we exploit a median absolute deviation based confidence interval to distinguish outlier-contaminated and normal channels, such that the elements of the diagonal weight matrix are either 0 or 1. Subsequently, the resultant optimization task is addressed using the alternating minimization method.

To address this, our work introduces a new perspective by analyzing frame-level temporal differences and reveals that deepfake speech exhibits erratic directional changes and unnatural local transitions compared to bonafide speech. Based on this finding, we propose a Temporal Difference Attention Module (TDAM) that redefines partial deepfake detection as identifying unnatural temporal variations, without relying on explicit boundary annotations. A dual-level hierarchical difference representation captures temporal irregularities at both fine and coarse scales, while adaptive average pooling preserves essential patterns across variable-length inputs to minimize information loss.

We present AgentPolyp, a novel framework driven by an intelligent agent that integrates CLIP-based semantic guidance and dynamic image enhancement with a lightweight segmentation network. The agent adaptively selects reinforcement learning strategies to perform context-aware denoising, contrast adjustment, and artifact reduction.

To address this, we propose Semantic and Spatial Dual Querying (SSDQ), a unified framework that integrates natural language descriptions and region-based spatial queries to guide Target Speaker Extraction (TSE). SSDQ employs dual query encoders for semantic and spatial cues, fusing them into the audio stream via a FiLM-based interaction module.

In this letter, to mitigate this limitation, we focus on the effect of Gaussian shapes on the scene reconstruction from sparse input views. The key idea is to allow each Gaussian to adaptively select its shape in accordance with the scene structure. Specifically, we propose to put a learnable parameter into Gaussian attributes, which indicates the probability of each shape. This indicator is optimized with other attributes while making each Gaussian change its shape to 1D, 2D, and 3D for representing edges, planar surfaces, and volumetric regions, respectively. Based on a geometrically accurate representation, the proposed method consequently alleviates the model from overfitting to a limited set of training views. Furthermore, we apply a depth regularization scheme within a set of selected pixels to precisely constrain positions of Gaussians. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method effectively improves the performance of novel view synthesis under sparse input views.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2025.3596225","National Research Foundation of Korea; Korea Government(grant numbers:RS-2023-NR076462); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11119067","Gaussian splatting;rendering;view synthesis","Shape;Three-dimensional displays;Training;Rendering (computer graphics);Overfitting;Image reconstruction;Image color analysis;Covariance matrices;Vectors;Noise","","","","29","IEEE","6 Aug 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, due to its inherent weak-signal measurements, the coherence of the laser light source, the roughness of the object under test or the complex scattering environment, QPI exhibits various types of complex noise, with Poisson-Gaussian noise and scattering noise being the main noise sources. In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the field of deep learning-based denoising algorithms, which have shown considerable efficacy in the denoising of individual noisy data. However, these algorithms have been observed to be less effective when confronted with other types of noisy data, and lack a unified model that can simultaneously remove complex noise from QPI. The present study proposes a QPI denoising approach based on the denoising diffusion probability model (DDPM). The denoising process of DDPM is comprised of two constituent parts: the forward process, which gradually adds standard Gaussian a priori noise to the original image until the image is completely random; and the reverse diffusion chain, which gradually recovers an undisturbed âcleanâ image by inference from a given a priori noise, thus eliminating various types of complex noise in QPI. A comparative analysis was conducted between the conventional denoising approach based on BM3D and the deep network denoising algorithm with U-Net as the backbone, and the proposed method was evaluated through experimental validation using simulated Gaussian noise, scattering noise and fluorescence microscopy dataset (FMD). The experimental results demonstrate the superior denoising, detail restoration and generalization performance of the proposed method, signifying its significant potential for practical applications.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2025.3582187","National Natural Science Foundation of China NSFC(grant numbers:62305113); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11045974","Quantitative phase imaging (QPI);diffusion model;FMD dataset","Noise;Noise reduction;Speckle;Optical filters;Training;Microscopy;Optical variables control;Optical refraction;Optical interferometry;Optical imaging","","","","21","IEEE","24 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
